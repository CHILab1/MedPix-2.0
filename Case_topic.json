Occasionally, a congenital weakness in the bladder wall adjacent to the ureteral orifice results in a diverticulum.  This is termed a \"Hutch\" diverticulum.\nIn children, outlet obstruction causing a diverticulum is rare and can be seen with urethral valves.  In men, diverticula are associated with outlet obstruction from urethral stricture, prostatic hypertrophy, prostatic carcinoma etc.  acquired diverticula are rare in women.\nDiverticula usually occur on the lateral bladder walls, rarely the dome.  They are often multiple.  Large diverticula often displace the bladder and or ureters.  \ndiverticula can have wide or narrow necks.  The wide necked variety empty urine readily.  The narrow neck type are slow to empty and therefore are more likely to have urinary stasis.\nInfection, tumor and stone formation can occur as a result of urine stasis within a diverticulum.  Tumor formation in a diverticulum is more likely to spread beyond the bladder because the diverticulum wall consists only of urothelium without muscle.\nBladder diverticula can be evaluated with excretory urography, ultrasound, CT and cystoscopy.\n\nRef:\nDunnick, R., McCallum, R., Sandler, C., Textbook of Uroradiology.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Ovarian torsion is caused by partial or complete rotation of the ovary on its mesenteric pedicle.  This results first in compromise of the lymphatic and venous drainage, causing congestion and edema of the ovarian parenchyma and eventually leading to loss of the arterial perfusion and infarction.  The condition is a surgical emergency much like a testicular torsion.   Torsions may occur in normal or abnormal (ie ovarian cyst, dermoid) ovaries.  This condition usually occurs in children and younger woman who have more mobile adnexa.  \n\nThe imaging findings of ovarian torsion are variable.  However, any abnormal ovary on ultrasound in the proper clinical setting should suggest the diagnosis.  The sonographic findings depend on the degree of vascular compromise and whether an adnexal mass is present.  The ovary is usually enlarged.  Multiple enlarged cortical follicles in a big ovary with the proper history-acute lower quadrant pain (same side as the abnormal ovary), nausea, vomiting, mildly elevated WBC-is considered a specific sign.  Color and spectral Doppler examination may show absent flow in the affected ovary.  However this is neither a specific nor sensitive sign.  Torsed ovaries may have Doppler flow, and normal ovaries may not show flow on Doppler interrogation.   (Rumack, Diagnostic Ultrasound p.550)",

The American Thoracic Society recommends measurement of a CBC, serum electrolytes, calcium, alkaline phosphatase, albumin, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, and creatinine in all patients with lung cancer.  Abnormal LFTs should be followed up with a contrast-enhanced CT of the liver, and an elevated alkaline phosphatase or calcium level should be followed up with a bone or PET scan to detect metastases (there is conflicting evidence as to which imaging modality has greater sensitivity).  Stage IV disease is primarily managed with chemotherapy or with palliative measures for symptomatic relief, and the five year survival rate is less than 5%."

The USPSTF concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to argue for or against screening asymptomatic individuals for lung cancer with either chest x-ray, low dose computerized tomography, sputum cytology, or a combination of these tests. Studies evaluating the benefits of screening have shown increased detection of early stage lung cancer in asymptomatic individuals but have not shown a reduction in mortality.  The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial is an ongoing trial evaluating the use of a single posterior-anterior CXR, and the Early Lung Cancer Action Project is currently evaluating the use of low-dose spiral CT for screening.",

The result is a comminuted fracture of the occipital condyle at the insertion of the alar and apical ligament complex.

It is considered stable unless the fracture completely separates the occipital condyle from the occiput. \n\n\nType III is an avulsion type fracture of the occipital condyle.

            "Title": "Interstital Lung Disease",
            "Disease Discussion": "INTERSTITIAL LUNG DISEASE --- The lung interstitium is composed of three components: bronchoarterial (axial), peripheral and parenchymal (using the terminology of Fraser and Pare). The axial component consists of the bronchovascular couplets (bronchiole and accompanying pulmonary artery). The peripheral space is composed of pulmonary veins and paired lymphatics and run within the interlobular septa. The peripheral component is continuous with the pleura. Finally, the interstitial parenchyma consists of the gas exchanging components of the lung (i.e. the walls of the alveoli). An understanding of these components allows one to think logically of the disease categories which affect the lung interstitium. This is especially true is regard to the interpretation of HRCT.\n\nWhile there are numerous methods by which to categorize ILD none are completely satisfying for ILD consists of a broad array of processes that share similar histopathologic and radiographic manifestations. Broadly they may be categorized as follows: (1) interstitial pneumonias (UIP, DIP), (2) diffuse infiltrative processes characterized by granuloma formation [e.g. sarcoidosis], (3) lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, (4) pneumoconioses, (5) ILD associated with cysts [LAM and EG], (6) disorders characterized by interlobular septal thickening (pulmonary edema, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and primary lymphangitic carcinomatosis), (7) eosinophilic syndromes, (8) pulmonary hemorrhage syndromes and (9) vasculitis. The combination of radiographic, clinical and laboratory findings are usually necessary to make a diagnosis and biopsy may be necessary to be definitive. \n\nPULMONARY ALVEOLAR PROTEINOSIS ---- PAP was shown to complicate the underlying COPD in the case presented. As noted above, PAP is within the category of diseases associated with interlobular septal thickening. Populations at risk for development of PAP include the immunocompromised (e.g lymphopenia in children and leukemia in adults); humans exposed to high concentrations of silicon dioxide; those infected with a variety of microorganisms (especially Nocardia, Aspergillus and Cryptococcus).\n\nPATHOLOGIC FINDINGS IN PAP show the alveoli to be filled with fine granular material which stains positive with periodic acid-Schiff stain (PAS+). Further histopathologic findings which may be present include: air-spaces filled with cholesterol crystals as well as needle-shaped crystals and laminated bodies (probably cellular fragments) and degenerating macrophages. Rarely interstitial fibrosis is present. \n\nRADIOGRAPHICALLY PAP was first described in a group of 27 patients in 1958. All demonstrated perihilar vaguely nodular air-space consolidation on plain film.  Less severe disease may manifest as ground-glass opacity only. In general, findings may range from ill defined nodular densities or patchy areas of confluence confined to the lower lung to diffuse consolidation throughout both lungs. On conventional CT PAP may manifest as ill defined consolidation, while on HRCT the characteristic \u201ccrazy-paving\u201d may be evident. This latter finding is secondary to a fine linear pattern forming (3-10mm) polygonal shapes superimposed on a background of GGO. Of special note is the fact that \u201ccrazy-paving\u201d is NOT pathognomonic of PAP. Differential considerations include BAC, lipid pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage, hydrostatic and permeability pulmonary edema, and bacterial pneumonia.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Congenital cholesteatoma\n\nCholesteatomas can be divided into two catagories, aquired cholesteatomas caused by traumatic, infectious or post surgical causes and congenital ectopic tissue rests.\n\nClinical criteria: pearly white mass medial to an intact tympanic membrane, a normal pars tensa and flaccida, and no history of otorrhea, perforation, or previous otologic procedure\n\nClinical presentation: Most common presentation is a white retrotympanic mass noted on routine otoscopy.  Now typically noted around the age of 4-5 years old.  If they go undetected other symptoms are determined by the middle ear structure they interfere with.  Facial nerve paralysis, conductive or sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo and extension into the middle fossa are all possibilities.  The most common complication is a conductive hearing loss due to fixation of the ossicles by the mass.  However, some large cholesteatomas can allow for sound conduction through the cholesteatoma itself.\n\nLocation: Most commonly found in the anterior superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane when found early, but as they grow they tend to migrate to the posterior hypotympanum.\n\nPathophysiology: There are four theories on how a congenital cholesteatoma is formed, the most widely accepted is the epithelial rest theory\n- Epithelial rests: Teed-Michael theory, ectodermal implants have been found in the 10 week old fetus between the first branchial cleft and pouch which is distinct from the surrounding tissue.  They have an unknown function and typically are resorbed at 33 weeks gestion.  If they do not involute then they may form a chronic cholesteatoma.  While there is histologic evidence of rests prior to 33 weeks there are now two documented histological cases such rests persisting after 33 weeks.\n- Invagination: This theory suggested that tissue from the external canal invaginates through the tympanic membrane due to a very small inflammatory injury near the neck of the malleus which causes adherence of squamous tissue to the malleus.  This may occur in utero or during childhood.   Another related theory is that there is no actual macroscopic perforation of the tympanic membrane, only microperforations of the basal layer.  This allows for squamous epithelium to enter the middle ear space.\n- Implantation: This is actually a theory against the existence of congenital cholesteatomas and implies that they are actually formed by unrecognized perforations of the tympanic membrane.\n- Metaplasia: This theory explains that epithelial tissue in the middle ear is via metaplasia to keratinizing squamous epithelium, although this theory appears to be unlikely due to the fact that most congenital cholesteatomas occur in one quadrant of the middle ear.\nHistology: Stratified squamous epithelial lined cyst which is filled with keratinous debris, this histology of a congential cholesteatoma is exactly the same as an acquired cholesteatoma.\nRadiology: High resolution CT of the temporal bone is the ideal modality for imaging congenital cholesteatomas, especially since most patients are young and without other ear pathology found in patients with aquired cholesteatomas.  On CT a cholesteatoma appears as a hypodense lesion with well defined margins which does not enhance with constrast.\nMR imaging of the temporal bone may also be used.  This will show low signal on T1W with moderately high signal on T2W images.  It does not enhance with gadolinium.  MR imaging is useful for differentiating a cholesteatoma from other intracranial processes. \n\nTreatment: Surgical resection with either complete removal of the cholesteatoma matrix or permanent exteriorization is curative.  Depending on the size and location of the cholesteatoma a transtympanic, transmastoid, middle cranial fossa approach or a transphenoidal approach may be used.",

The C1 ring much like the pelvic ring will not typically fracture in one place.  Multiple fracture points allow displacement of the lateral masses usually seen on the AP open mouth view of the c-spine series.  Although plain films are routinely used in evaluation of the trauma patient, anyone suspected to have disruption of the C1 or other cervical vertebrae should undergo CT evaulation.  Plain film criteria for diagnosis of Jefferson fracture states that the C1 lateral masses must be displaced greater than 2mm and must extend beyond the margins of C2.   CT is used to better define the fracture fragments and to determine any compromise of the spinal cord."

Additionally, a non-contrast CT performed 1 month ago showed increased thickness of the pancreatic head.  A pre- and post-contrast CT were obtained to evaluate for change.\n\nThis is a presumptive diagnosis of diffuse fatty liver disease.  The causes for which are many, for instance, alcoholism, obesity, malnutrition, steroid therapy, and diabetes mellitus. Laboratory testing of liver function tests could aid in further diagnosis.  CT imaging is consistent with this diagnosis as the liver appears less dense than the spleen.  Given that the liver findings were discovered incidentally and the patient has been asymptomatic there is no need to aggressively pursue this with further imaging or biopsy.  However, from a medical record review, the patient reported that her primary care manager requested that she be taken off acetaminophen because of high liver function tests.  The results of this test were unavailable. So significant delay in diagnosis could lead to long-term liver damage.  Furthermore, most cases of fatty liver disease will resolve if the etiology is discovered and the offending agent is removed.\n\nThe appearance of focal fatty sparing is concerning and could misinterpreted as liver tumor, primary of metastasis.  In this case, the focal sparing is in a triangular shape near the portal vein which is consistent with fat sparing and not a mass.  \n\nAccessory lobes of liver are normal variant and if asymptomatic require no intervention."

            "Title": "Hepatic fatty infiltration with focal sparing",
            "Disease Discussion": "Fatty metamorphosis is a common metabolic response of the liver to a variety of inciting agents and disease states.  These agents and states include corticosteroids, chemotherapy, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hepatotoxic drugs, obesity, severe hepatitis, chronic alcoholism, malnutrition / malabsorption, jejuno-ileal and jejunocolic bypass surgery, hyperalimentation, congestive heart failure, and blunt hepatic trauma.  Despite these associations, the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms remain obscure.  Possibly diminished portal venous perfusion has a significant effect on producing fatty change and altering hepatic density.  A relative hepatocellular ischemia is proposed to result in decreased parenchymal glycogen and increased accumulations of fat.  The fat content of the liver may rise as high as 40% - 50% of the weight, well above the normal value of approximately 5%.\nRegional variation in amount of liver-cell fat can produce entities called pseudolesions or pseudotumors, usually discovered during imaging. Focal fatty sparing in an otherwise fatty liver  occurs in several typical locations: along the gallbladder fossa, along the falciform ligament, occasionally in the periphery of the liver and near the hilum which is perfused with low-insulin blood from a pyloric vein. Because focal fatty sparing can only occur in the presence of fatty liver disease, most of these patients have a history of one of the disease states or agent exposures mentioned above.\n\nClassic features that will help differentiate focally fatty sparing from a hypoechoic mass are that it occurs in these typical locations, often has a geographic (triangular or quadrangular) shape vice being round like most masses and focally fatty sparing, since it is not a mass, will not demonstrate mass effect on adjacent structures, particularly crossing vessels.",

            "Title": "Pulmonary Embolism",
            "Disease Discussion": "Pulmonary embolism (PE) can be associated with significant mortality if untreated. The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is unreliable. Symptoms of PE include tachypnea/dyspnea (most common), tachycardia, hypoxia, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, syncope, and atrial fibrillation. Blood gas may be normal. \n\nThe D-dimer blood test is a screening tool for pulmonary embolism. A serum level less than 500 ng/L excludes pulmonary embolism with a 90% accuracy. A positive test is non-specific. Additionally, the test is unreliable in the presence of malignancy, sepsis, recent surgery, or trauma. \n\nThe source is  most commonly from deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity,  however, about 10% arise from clot in the upper extremity.  Risk factors are  Immobilization, Recent Surgery, Underlying Malignancy, History of Deep Venous Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism, Estrogen use, or Pre-existing cardiac disease. A low percentage of cases of pulmonary embolism result in pulmonary infarction, due to the presence of the bronchial circulation. \n\nTreatment for PE most commonly consists of anticoagulation with heparin or coumadin. Anticoagulation prevents clot propagation and allows endogenous fibrinolytic activity to dissolve existing thrombiAnticoagulation decreases mortality form 30-60% to <5%.  \nThrombolytic agents are not routinely used for the treatment of acute PE. Thrombolytic treatment is generally reserved for patients with massive pulmonary embolism producing circulatory shock (hypotension).\n\nFor patients that cannot be anticoagulated, an inferior vena caval filter can be placed in order to prevent life-threatening PE. Major complications occur in about 1% of cases. Complications include central migration of the filter, filter fracture, inferior vena caval perforation, and vena caval thrombosis.\nV/Q scanning has been the mainstay for screening symptomatic patients for the presence of pulmonary embolism. A negative V/Q scan essentially excludes PE, and a high probability study is associated with the presence of a PE in about 85% of cases at angiography. Confusion arises with low or intermediate probability examinations, and there is common disagreement among expert readers in the interpretation of scans in these categories. The problem with V/Q scanning is that it does not directly visualize thromboembolism, but rather its effects on perfusion and ventilation . This problem causes the need for probability criteria, which in turn causes confusing results.  Nuclear medicine scanning for PE is probably most useful in previously healthy patients with a normal chest radiograph.   As the complexity of the patients underlying cardiopulmonary disease increases, so does the likelihood that the scan will not be informative (intermediate probability). Using PIOPED criteria, intermediate probability V/Q scans occurred in 60% of patients with COPD, but in only 13% of patients with normal CXR's. However, a generalized abnormality on CXR such as diffuse pulmonary edema or reticulonodular disease may not cause the perfusion lung scan to be abnormal.\n\nThe CXR is abnormal in the majority of cases of PE. The PIOPED study showed that among patients with angiographically proven pulmonary embolism, only 12% had chest X-rays interpreted as normal.  (24% of patients with PE in another study had normal CXR's ). Atelectasis and other focal pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are the most common CXR findings in pulmonary embolism, occurring in up to 68% of patients with PE.  Pleural effusions are also common but usually small and  unilateral. Other palin film findings indicative of PE include regional oligemia (Westermark sign), a pleural-based wedge shaped area of increased opacity (Hampton's hump), and prominence of the central pulmonary artery with abrupt tapering (Knuckle sign).\n\nIn pulmonary angiography,an embolus classiclally produces a filling defect within the affected pulmonary artery. Non-occlusive emboli have a \"tram-track\" appearance. Although considered the gold standard, angiography may not always detect the presence of emboli. Some indirect angiographic evidence for the presence of emboli such as vascular pruning and delayed capillary blush are non-specific. Additionally, agreement among angiographers regarding the presence of subsegmental emboli is poor  and can be as low as 15%. V/Q scans can provide a road map to angiography, but if the abnormally perfused segment on the V/Q scan appears normal at angiography, complete evaluation the remainder of the lungs for the presence of pulmonary emboli is warranted. One important point to remember is that a negative angiogram has been shown to be an excellent indicator of a good prognosis. \n\nHelical CT is able to identify main, lobar, and segmental emboli with a reported sensitivity over 90%. Although the detection of subsegmental emboli is worse, the clinical significance of these small emboli has not yet been establishished. Additionally, on angiography there is poor interobserver agreement for the presence of subsegmental emboli  and the true incidence of isolated subsegmental emboli is difficult to determine. Helical CT has also been shown to have a significantly better sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values compared to V/Q scanning . Helical CT permits a more confident diagnosis to be made in a greater number of cases when compared with V/Q scanning . \n\nIt has been suggested that helical or electron beam CT should be the initial imaging modality to screen patients suspected of having PE- particularly in patients with abnormal CXR's in whom there is a greater likelihood of inconclusive V/Q scan results. If emboli are detected, no further work-up is required. If this study is negative, a lower extremity US or CT DVT exam can be performed to assess for the presence of DVT.

Those who are most susceptible to dissemination include the immunocompromised, pregnant women, and certain ethnic groups, such as Latinos, Filipinos, and African Americans. The most common antifunals used to treat disseminated coccidioidomycosis includes amphotericin B and the azoles. The patient was initially placed on amphotericin B and fluconazole, but his disease progressed. He was placed on itraconazole and posaconazole with no improvement. He was then placed on interferon gamma because it was believed that his immune system was unable to recognize Coccidiodes. He was also placed on posaconazole, after which he improved. He was discharged from the hospital. He will require lifelong antifungal therapy."

There is a slight male predominance.\n\nGross Pathology:\n  -Mycetoma: Cheesy, semisolid mass\n  -Invasive Fungal Sinusitis: Necrotic tissue\n  -Allergic Fungal sinusitis: Brownish or green-black thick mucous with \"cottage cheese\" consistency\n\nHistology: \n -Mycetoma:Fungal hyphae that are tightly packed without allergic mucin.  No tissue invasion.  Calcification can be seen within.\n -Invasive fungal sinusitis: Invasion of mucosa and blood vessels by fungal hyphae. Mucormycosis is the other common organism.\n -Allergic fungal sinusitis: Non-invasive fungi along with eosinophils.  Charcot-Leyden crystals are seen, which are needle-shaped crystalline structures that represent breakdown products of eosinophils.  Other fungi that can also cause: Curvularia, Bipolaris, Fusarium, and Pseudallescheria.\n\nSpecial  Stains: Gomori methenamine silver \n\n\n\nRadiology: \n\n-Invasive Fungal Sinusitis: In patients with invasive fungal sinusitis bone destruction and soft tissue invasion are seen (infiltration of periantral and retroantral fat). On CT bone erosion as well as complete or partial opacification of the affected sinus is seen. CT angiography may reveal vessel involvement (dissection, narrowing, occlusion). Variable signal is seen on T1 and T2.  On post contrast imaging enhancement of the involved tissues is seen.\n\n-Allergic Fungal Sinusitis: On CT, allergic fungal sinusitis typically shows high density material within the sinuses.  On MRI there is low T1 and T2 weighted signal in the sinuses. The peripheral inflamed mucosa will enhance on post contrast imaging.\n\n-Mycetoma: In patients who are otherwise healthy, occasionally a mycetoma may develop. This sometimes occurs afer the chang in the local sinus microenvironment, as can be seen after sinus surgery or radiation therapy. This involves one sinonasal cavity, and on CT is seen as a focal mass within the sinus lumen.  It typically has areas of high density and may have calcification.  The adjacent bone is thick and sclerotic as a result of chronic inflammation. After the administration of contrast, the inflamed mucosa at the periphery of the sinus may enhance.  On MRI, a low signal mass on both T1 and T2 is seen within the sinus.  Occasionally, on T2 the signal may be so low as to be mistaken for air.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: \n-Mycetoma: Surgical excision curative\n-Invasive Fungal Sinusitis: Radical debridment, IV amphotericin B, with use of itraconazole as long-term suppressive treatment.  Acute fungal sinusitis is life-threatening and can be lethal within a matter of hours.  \n-Allergic Fungal Sinusitis: May be treated with topical and systemic antifungal agents along with topical steroids and saline irrigation.  Also, may undergo surgical debridement.\n---------------------------------------------------------\neMedicine Topic - http://www.emedicine.com/ent/topic510.htm",

            "Disease Discussion": "Multidetector CT imaging, with faster acquisition of images and utilization of contrast-tracking/event-triggering protocols like CARE Bolus (Siemens) or SmartPrep (GE), is fast becoming the imaging modality of choice for many acute clinical settings such as trauma and the diagnoses of pulmonary embolism as well as aortic dissection.  For the purposes of aortic dissection, the literature advocates at least a four-row CT scanner, with 150 ml dose of non-ionic contrast material intravenously at a rate of 3 ml/sec, with the region of interest for the event-triggering at the level of the thoracic descending aorta.\n\nAortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that is the most common cause of aortic emergency.  Classification of aortic dissection can be via the DeBakey system, but a simpler Stanford system is now commonly used.  Under the Stanford classification system, a dissection involving the ascending aorta is a type A and any dissection which is limited to the descending thoracic aorta (distal to the left subclavian artery origin) is a type B.  Stanford type A dissections are treated surgically, as these have life-threatening complications such as hemopericardium, dissection which compromises the coronary artery ostia and subsequent massive myocardial infarcts, and severe acute aortic insufficiency causing heart failure and death. Stanford type B dissections, on the other hand, are typically more stable and can be treated medically with close surveillance.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Grave\u2019s ophthalmopathy (orbitopathy).  Although rare, it can occur in 2% patients with a history of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis.  Grave\u2019s and Hashimoto\u2019s diseases are on opposite sides of the thyroid disease spectrum \u2014 manifesting hyperthyroid and hypothyroid symptoms, respectively.  Both diseases can occur in the same person with variable temporal manifestations.  However, the majority of ophthalmopathy cases correlate with Grave\u2019s disease.\n\nApproximately 10% of patients who have ophthalmopathy do not have clinical thyroid disease and are considered euthyroid, but do have elevated serum thyroid autoantibodies and thyroid-specific T-cells circulating.  Within the remaining 90% who do have clinical thyroid disease, approximately 40% have ophthalmic presentation within 6 months after diagnosis of hyperthyroidism, 20% have concurrent clinical thyroid and ophthalmic disease presentation, and 20% have ophthalmic involvement prior to diagnosis of thyroid disease.  Grave\u2019s orbitopathy affects about 16 women and 3 men in a population of 100,000 per year with men having greater severity of disease.    \n\nRisk factors for development of Grave's ophthalmopathy are female, positive family history autoimmune diseases, smoking, age, and radioiodine therapy for Grave's hyperthyroidism (compared to surgery or antithyroid drugs). \n\nGrave\u2019s orbitopathy results in bilateral proptosis, lid retraction, chemosis, and vision changes in affected persons attributing to the increase in retroorbital connective tissue and extraocular muscle enlargement.  Complications may involve corneal ulceration and infection due to loss of eye protection and lubrication.\n\nThe pathogenesis involves autoantibodies against thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) antigens that can be found in the thyroid as well as in other tissues.  It is unknown why retroorbital tissues are predominantly affected.  Studies show that retroorbital fibroblasts and adipocytes express TSHR mRNA suggesting the mechanism of TSHR antibodies directly stimulating the fibroblasts and adipocytes resulting in increased production of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and fat tissue.\n\nAnother mechanism in the pathogenesis of Grave's ophthalmopathy involves T-cells that recognize self TSHR antigens as foreign.  This autoimmune process stimulates T-cells to produce cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and interferon gamma that recruit lymphocytes and create inflammation and edema within the orbit.  Hence, there is lymphocytic infiltration of extraocular muscles and associated edema accounting for muscle belly enlargement.  It is not known why the inferior recti are usually affected first, followed by the medial recti, then superior recti, and lastly the lateral recti, but this is a consistent finding.\n\nTreatment for Grave's ophthalmopathy depends on severity of symptoms.  If present, treat hyperthyroidism with methimazole.  For mild involvement including dry, irritated eyes, natural tears are helpful during the day and an eye lubricant (methycellulose) is appropriate at night.  For moderate disease that can include conjunctival erythema, progressive proptosis, and diplopia, prednisone 30mg daily for 4 weeks should be initiated additionally.  \n\nExternal radiation may be used in conjunction to prednisone if high dose is contraindicated or not tolerated in the case of persistent orbital edema.

            "Disease Discussion": "Carcinoids are neuroendocrine neoplasms that are considered malignant based on potential for metastasis (15%)\u2014typically to the liver, bone, adrenals, and brain.  While the vast majority of carcinoids arise in the GI tract (~90%), bronchial carcinoid accounts for 1-2% of all lung neoplasms. These lesions are classified from low grade (typical) to high grade (atypical).  Both extremes have similar imaging features, with the majority of lesions being centrally located, well-defined, and round-to-ovoid in shape.  Calcifications are common; there is no association with tobacco use.  Typical age at presentation is wide, with a mean of 45 years, affecting males and females equally.\n\nApproximately 20% of bronchial carcinoids arise peripherally, distal to the segmental bronchi.  The majority of these neoplasms are of the atypical subtype.  Both typical and atypical subtypes can be associated with hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy; hyperplasia results from repeated post-obstructive infections or metastasis.  Local nodal metastasis is more common in atypical carcinoids.\n\nGiven the majority of bronchial carcinoids arise within or adjacent to the central bronchi, the most common presenting symptoms are secondary to obstruction with resultant infection or air-trapping.  The lesions tend to be vascular, and hemotypsis is the presenting symptom in ~50%.  Up to 25% of patients are asymptomatic.\n\nPrognosis is dependent on the subtype, with typical carcinoids having 92% 5-year and 76% 15-year survival rates.  Atypical lesions carry a somewhat more dismal 69% and 52% 5/15-year survival rate.  Treatment is by surgical excision.",

            "Title": "biliary leak, status post laparoscopic cholecystectomy",
            "Disease Discussion": "Laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) has replaced open cholecystectomy for most routine treatment of gallbladder disease by cholecystectomy due to clear advantages associated with any laparoscopic procedures, namely shortened inpatient stays, smaller incisions yielding better cosmetic results and requiring smaller amounts of pain medication, better pulmonary toilet due to better pain control, and so on. (1, 2)  Early days of LC demonstrated a higher incidence of bile duct injuries and biliary leak, and initially this phenomenon was attributed to the \"learning curve\", but there is increasing evidence that the \"learning curve\" may not be entirely the reason why this is so. (2)\n\nIn the literature, biliary leaks after LC occur in approximately 1% of patients.  In a series of 64 patients with leaks addressed with endoscopic evaluation (ERCP), the vast majority of the leaks (50) were from the cystic duct.  Other places of biliary leaks were the ducts of Luschka (4), common bile duct (6), and common hepatic duct (4). (5)\n\nScintigraphic evaluation of patients with potential biliary leaks after LC has been clearly established in the literature (3, 4).  Other anatomic modalities such as US or CT can demonstrate a fluid collection, and a bile leak can be suggested from history, but it would be difficult to actually demonstrate a leak via purely anatomic studies alone.  Scintigraphic evaluation with an agent such as Tc99m-disofenin, as in this case, will clearly demonstrate whether or not the fluid collection is indeed a leakage of bile from the biliary system.\n\nTreatment of biliary leaks in this setting can be done by percutaneous drainage, but the literature demonstrates increasing use of endoscopic evaluation, sphincterotomy, and possible stent placement.  The rationale is that by decreasing the resistance of the normal flow through the common bile duct and into the duodenum, the biliary leak will, in time, close itself.  Percutaneous drainage may be appropriate for patients with possible infection of the bile collection within the peritoneal cavity, which was suspected in this case. (1, 2, 5)",

While pilocytic astrocytomas (PA) are usually cystic with an enhancing mural nodule, this case represents the less common solid variant.  Approximately 85% of posterior fossa astrocytomas in childhood are pilocytic - the remainder are fibrillary-diffuse.  Pilocytic astrocytomas are WHO Grade 1; whereas fibrillary may be Grade 2-4. Enhancement in PA is almost universal.  Enhancement in diffuse astrocytoma is associated with vascular changes and a higher tumor grade - either Grade 3 or Grade 4.\n\nClick here to see other Pilocytic Astrocytomas:\nhttp://rad.usuhs.mil/medpix/medpix.html?mode=image_finder&action=search&srchstr=pilocytic%20astrocytoma&srch_type=all#top\n\nClick here to see Medulloblastoma:\nhttp://rad.usuhs.mil/medpix/medpix.html?mode=image_finder&action=search&srchstr=medulloblastoma&srch_type=all#top\n\nClick here to see Ependymoma:\nhttp://rad.usuhs.mil/medpix/medpix.html?mode=image_finder&action=search&srchstr=ependymoma&srch_type=all#top"

            "Disease Discussion": "Cerebellar  astrocytoma  accounts  for about 11 - 30% of primary CNS tumors in children, and has a post-resection survival of up to  94% at 10 years.  This tumor makes up about one-third of childhood posterior fossa tumors, typically presenting  late  in  the  first decade  or  in  the  early second decade.  These well-circumscribed masses are often completely  resected surgically,  with  no  other therapy required.\n\nCerebellar  astrocytoma  tends  to involve the hemispheres, although extension into or origin  within  the  vermis  or  even  the fourth  ventricle  have  been  described infrequently.  It may be predominantly cystic with a mural nodule (as shown in a  different patient,  Film .4), multicystic, or predominantly solid (diffuse) on CT or MR.  Recognizable cysts occur in up to 80%.   Histologically, most  are juvenile  pilocytic astrocytomas similar to those of the third ventricle region.   Diffuse  infiltrating  fibrillary  types occur  in  up  to  15%  of cerebellar astrocytomas and  have  a less favorable prognosis.    Frank   malignancy,   leptomeningeal seeding, and spontaneous hemorrhage are distinctly unusual.\n\nRadiographically,  cerebellar  astrocytoma  arises  within  the cerebellar hemisphere and less  often  in the  vermis,  and  displaces the fourth ventricle without invading it.  On CT, 10-25% contain foci of calcification.  The mass is hypointense on T1-weighted  and  hyperintense on  T2-weighted MR, with one or more cystic components.  After contrast administration, the  mural  nodule  and/or  solid  components enhance, rendering nonenhancing cysts more conspicuous.\n\nIn  children, vermian or diffuse astrocytoma or those involving the fourth ventricle may mimic medulloblastoma or ependymoma.  In older    adolescents    or    adults,   hemangioblastoma   may   present as a cystic mass indistinguishable from cerebellar astrocytoma.  Metastasis  is  the most  common  posterior  fossa  neoplasm in adulthood.  Rarely vascular malformation,  abscess,  or   lymphoma   might   have   a   similar radiographic appearance.",

Cerebral hemorrhage is the next most common with almost 1 in 5 patients.  Venous occlusive disease is the next, but much less frequent than the previous mentioned etiologies.\n\nThe two most common causes of thromboembolic disease are atherosclerosis and cardiac origin.  Atherosclerosis follows a typical distribution of accumulation within the arterial distribution of the brain.  The internal carotid artery is first, then the distal basilar artery, carotid siphon, and middle cerebral artery.  The parts of the brain perfused by the middle cerebral artery and basilar artery are most vulnerable to infarct due both the region of atherosclerotic disease and flow patterns that cause more proximal sources of thrombus to favor those vessels.\n\nThe first patient\u2019s infarct is due to occlusion of penetrating vessels of the right middle cerebral artery.  Likely the lenticulostriates which supply the lentiform nucleus, caudate capsule, and internal capsule, as well as the thalamoperferators were affected.  These types of strokes, when smaller than 15mm, are called lacunar infarcts and they account for 20% of all strokes.  Patients with lacunar infarcts can present with a pure motor hemiparesis like this patient or a pure hemisensory deficit, hemiparetic ataxia, dysarthria, or hand deficit.\n\nCT examination early in the course of an acute stroke can be negative and cannot exclude this diagnosis.  Stroke in the emergent setting is more a clinical diagnosis and if suspected, imaging with MR is prudent.  CT, CTA, MR, and diffusion-perfusion imaging can be useful in management decisions regarding thrombolysis.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Stress fractures occur when normal bone is subjected to abnormal stress or repetitive stress, and they typically occur in athletes who have either recently changed their type of training or have increased their level of training. Bone is a very dynamimc tissue that continuously remodels as a result of altering stresses. Repetitive stress overload results in an imbalance of bone remodeling. The abnormal level of stress results in the bone resorption exceeding the rate of bone repalcement leading to a weakening of the bone.  There is a continuum of injury beginning with weakening of the bone, fatigue, stress fracture and finally, complete fracture of the involved bone.\n\nStress injuries of bones are very common among athletes and can occur in nearly any bone, however, the vast majority of stress injuries occur in the bones of the lower extremity. Tarsal navicular stress fractures typically occur in elite athletes, including runners, basketball players, gymnasts, and football players. Those athletes that play on artificial turf seem to be at an increased risk for stress fractures of the tarsal navicular bone.\n\nThe diagnosis of tarsal navicular stress fracture is often delayed many weeks to months because the onset of symptoms are insidious and in addition, the diagnosis is often difficult to make on conventional radiographs. Patients usually present with pain along the dorsal aspect of the foot which is made worse by running or jumping. Tarsal navicular stress fractures are usually treated with casting and athletes typically return to full activity within 5 to 6 months. If a complete fracture occurs, the individual may require internal fixation, which can delay return to normal activity.\n\nMost tarsal navicular stress fractures occur in the middle third of the navicular bone, which is a relatively avascular portion of the bone. The fracture may be complete or incomplete, however the incomplete fractures tend to begin along the dorsal aspect of the bone adjacent to the talonavicular joint. Foot anomalies can be associated with stress fractures of the tarsal navicular. This injury is most often seen in individuals that have a short first metatarsal or long second metatarsal. This is thought to result in increased shear forces being transmitted along the second metatarsal through the middle cunieform and into the middle third of the navicular bone.\n\nEvaluation of a suspected stress injury of the tarsal navicular should begin with radiographs of the foot, however this area of the navicular is difficult to visualize on radiographs and MR or CT is often required to correctly establish the diagnosis.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in several affected organs. It is typically a disease of young adults, with a peak incidence in the third decade. The diagnosis is suggested by a combination of consistent clinical and radiological findings along with the presence of some nonspecific features such as depressed delayed-type hypersensitivity, abnormal immunoglobulins, hypercalcaemia, and elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. It can be confirmed by biopsy evidence of widespread noncaseating granulomas. Pulmonary involvement accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with sarcoidosis. The disease has a worse prognosis in blacks than whites, with a greater tendency for chronicity and multiorgan involvement.\n\nAbout 90% of patients will have an abnormal chest radiograph at some stage, showing lymphadenopathy, parenchymal opacities, or both. Other findings are uncommon and seldom occur in isolation. Sarcoidosis is traditionally staged according to its appearance on the chest radiograph: stage I, lymphadenopathy; stage II, lymphadenopathy with parenchymal opacity; stage III, parenchymal opacity alone. Low stages at presentation carry a better prognosis than high stages. \n\nLymphadenopathy is evident on the chest radiograph in about 70\u201380% of patients at some time during the course of the condition. Sarcoidosis is characterized by bilateral, symmetrical hilar and paratracheal lymphadenopathy. In 90% of patients with lymphadenopathy, nodal enlargement is maximal on the first radiograph and usually disappears within 6\u201312 months. In about 5%, however, large nodes persist more or less indefinitely, and these can be a source of confusion when found later with other incidental chest pathology. Recurrence of lymphadenopathy is virtually unrecorded. The lymph nodes may calcify, sometimes in a characteristic eggshell fashion. This latter feature is shared by only a few conditions. \n\nAbout 40% of patients presenting with nodal enlargement will develop parenchymal opacities, usually within a year, and of these, about one third will go on to have persistent (fibrotic) shadowing. Nodal enlargement does not develop after parenchymal opacities have appeared.\n\nParenchymal changes probably occur histologically in all patients but are only detected on the chest radiograph in 50\u201370% of cases. They may be classified as reversible, nonreversible (fibrotic), and mixed. Changes may resolve completely (two thirds of cases) or in part, leaving irreversible fibrosis. There are three major patterns of reversible opacity: irregular or rounded 2-4mm nodules, patchy airspace consolidation, or rarely 1-4cm irregular nodules. Characteristically they appear as the nodal enlargement is subsiding, in contrast to lymphoma in which these abnormalities tend to progress in unison. \n\nParenchymal opacities are well demonstrated on high-resolution CT. High-resolution CT is very sensitive and the findings are frequently highly specific for sarcoidosis. The principal abnormality is 1\u20135 mm nodules distributed in a perilymphatic fashion, predominantly along the bronchovascular bundles and subpleurally and, to a lesser extent, along interlobular septa.\n\nOther manifestations of sarcoidosis include pleural thickening and effusions. These are unusual though and do not occur in isolation. \n\nCor pulmonale, mycetoma formation and pneumothorax are all recognized complications of this fibrotic stage.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Pathology: Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory process of the bowel that can affect any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus. It is likely multifactoral including  genetic influence, dysfunctional immune response, enteric normal flora bacteria, and other environmental factors.  It is believed to be the result of an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Most cases involve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Crohn disease typically affects the bowel asymmetrically, involving the mesenteric side more severely than the antimesenteric border. Although any area of the GI system may be affected, the most common site of disease is the ileo-cecal region, followed by the colon.  Microscopically, the initial lesion appears as a focal inflammatory infiltrate around the crypts, followed by ulceration of superficial mucosa, then by deeper invasion and non-caseating granulomas. Grossly, the early abnormality is hyperemia and edema of the involved mucosa. Later, superficial ulcers form, which become deep serpentine linear ulcers located both longitudinally and transversely giving the mucosa a \u201ccobblestone\u201d appearance. The lesions are often segmental; being separated by healthy areas, hence the term \u201cskip lesions\u201d. Transmural inflammation results in thickening of the bowel wall and narrowing of the lumen. As the disease progresses, it is complicated by obstruction, fistula formation, abscess formation, adhesions, and malabsorption.\n\nClinical: The characteristic presentation of Crohn disease is with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which may be complicated by intestinal fistula formation, obstruction, or both. Unpredictable flares and remissions with a long course characterize Crohn\u2019s. Treatment is generally medical including antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, and sometimes antibiotics. Chronic complications include fistulas, adhesions, and marked luminal narrowing with partial bowel obstruction which may require surgery.\n\nRadiographic findings:\nRadiological evaluation includes diagnosis, evaluation of distribution, and evaluation for complications. The distribution of small bowel Crohn\u2019s disease is best assessed by enteroclysis and CT. The terminal ileum is nearly always involved in small bowel disease and is the only site in up 30 % of patients.\n  \nSmall bowel contrast studies: The sensitivity of enteroclysis is reported as very good in detecting Crohn\u2019s disease but often does not correlate well with disease activity. Superficial abnormalities include thickened folds due to mucosal edema, transverse and longitudinal ulcers, punctate collections of barium, and small nodules. Transmural abnormalities include deep fissures and penetrating ulcers.  Cobblestoning results from intersecting longitudinal and transverse ulcers with intervening heaped-up edematous tissue.  Deep ulcerations may result in fistulae. Thickened bowel may appear as separations of loops. Luminal narrowing is always present resulting from spasm and edema during the acute phase or fibrotic strictures in chronic disease. Ileitis can also manifest as a \u201csting sign\u201d on barium study secondary to spasm or fibrotic stricture fromation.  The mesenteric aspect and adjacent mesentery are commonly affected more than the antimesenteric border. Extramural mesenteric inflammation and abscesses may induce compression and displacement of bowel loops.\n\nCross sectional imaging: Both CT and MR imaging are reported to have a sensitivity of over 95% for the detection of Crohn disease.  At more advanced stages, CT and MR imaging can help identify and characterize pathologically altered bowel segments as well as extraluminal lesions including abscesses, fat stranding, and adenopathy.  Cross sectional imaging can also clearly depict inflammatory lesions and conditions that require elective gastrointestinal surgery, aiding in treatment planning.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Goldenhar Syndrome comprises a spectrum of congenital facial, ocular and vertebral abnormalities.  First described in 1952 by Dr. Goldenhar, this rare syndrome involves malformations of the ear (microtia), mandible, maxilla, eye, facial muscles and vertebral bodies.  In the majority of cases, these malformations occur unilaterally, although bilaterality can occur.  When these findings occur unilaterally, and without vertebral involvement, the disorder is often referred to as hemifacial microsomia.  Additional involvement of the vertebral bodies is then referred to as Goldenhar syndrome.  Overall these grouped malformations fall under the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAV spectrum).  The heart, limbs and kidneys can also be affected within this spectrum.\n\n     Goldenhar syndrome is believed to occur randomly without an any genetic cause, although research into a multifactoral inheritance pattern is ongoing.  This disorder occurs more frequently in males (~70%), and is associated clinically with hearing, vision, and mastication problems.  Affected patients typically enjoy normal life expectancies and normal intelligence (approximately 10% of patient display moderate learning disabilities).  Cosmetic surgery consultation, orthodontic planning and speech and hearing therapy are important early interventions for patients with Goldenhar Syndrome.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Intestinal malrotation is an error of normal rotation of the midgut around the superior mesenteric artery and the midgut\u2019s fixation in the peritoneal cavity. Although the true incidence is unknown, it occurs in approximately 1 in 500 live births.  About sixty percent present in the first month of life, twenty percent present between one month and one year.  Intestinal malrotation in adults is rare.  Zissen suggests this anomaly should be sought in patients with a situs problem, inferior vena cava anomalies, polysplenia, or preduodenal portal vein.  \n\nAcute appendicitis in adults, although less frequent than in adolescents, is much more common than adult malrotation.  Both can present with obstructive symptoms in up to 50% of cases.  Like a symptomatic malrotation, an acute appendicitis requires immediate surgery for repair.  A symptomatic malrotation requires a Ladd\u2019s procedure.  An acute appendicitis requires an appendectomy.  \n\nZissen warns that intestinal malrotation in adults is usually an incidental finding on CT.  Therefore, it is important to continue to look for the cause of any acute symptoms.  Intestinal malrotation can be diagnosed on CT by the anatomic location of a right-sided small bowel, left-sided colon and an abnormal relationship of the superior mesenteric vessels.  Acute appendicitis will show inflammatory changes of the appendix associated with fat stranding, bowel wall thickening, luminal expansion and occasionally frank phlegmon.",

The classic presentation involves the triad of episodic headache, sweating, and tachycardia.  It is occasionally discovered incidentally on CT or MRI in 10% of patients.

It is associated with familial disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type II and in von Hippel-Lindau, therefore a family history and test for other associated abnormalities should be performed.  The diagnosis is typically confirmed by measuring elevated plasma and urinary catecholamines and their metabolites and from radiographic tests.   Treatment is primarily surgical with extirpation after the patient has been appropriately medically prepared, typically with a regimen of 10-14 days of alpha blockade.  Beta blockade may be added after adequate alpha blockade.  Hypertensive crises are typically treated with nitroprusside or phentolamine.  Surgery has a high morbidity rate of 40% and a mortality rate of 1-2%.  The tumor pathology often does not reveal if the tumor is malignant or benign.

            "Title": "Sarcoidosis",
            "Disease Discussion": "Clinical: Sarcoidosis is a disease of non caseating granulomas.  The specific etiology of sarcoidosis has not yet been identified, but it likely the combination of environmental and genetic factors. Events are triggered by an unknown factor with activation of pulmonary T cells and pulmonary alveolar macrophages. T cells proliferate in the lungs and release chemotactic factors which attract monocytes into the lungs, increasing the macrophage response which in turn leads to proliferation of fibroblasts with promotion of collagen synthesis and eventual fibrosis. Hypercalcemia and elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme are seen secondary to activation of pulmonary alveolar macrophages.  Hypercalcemia can lead to nephrocalcinosis. T cell changes in the lungs are not seen in the peripheral circulation where there is lymphopenia.  Manifestations are also seen in other organ systems. Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy is present in about 80% cases and is often asymptotic but may be associated with dull ache, malaise and fever. Generalized lymphadenopathy may occur in about 10%. Nervous system involvement includes cranial nerve palsies and neuropathy.  The eyes can be involved with uveitits and keratoconjuctivivits.  Skeletal manifestations include phalangeal cysts and arthritis.  The heart can be affected with cardiomyopathy and associated heart block.  In the united stated, sarcoid is more common in blacks. In blacks, the skin, joints, and eyes are more often involved.   Additionally, manifestation of the disease tends to be more florid in blacks.  \n\nRadiographic findings: Plain film CXR abnormalities are found in over 90% of patients.  Bilateral hilar adenopathy is most common, oftentimes with right paratracheal and AP window adenopathy. Subcarinal nodes are less common. Lymph nodes can calcify, usually in an amorphous, popcorn-like fashion.  Nodal calcification is related to duration of disease. Sarcoid causes interstitial lung disease, which can have a variety of appearances: a reticulo-nodular pattern is the most common and is typically bilateral and symmetric. An alveolar pattern with small indistinct nodular opacities can be seen but is actually the result of interstitial lung disease.\nCT is more sensitive in the detection of adenopathy and parenchymal lung disease.  HRCT is used to evaluate for parenchymal lung disease demonstrating nodular peribronchiovascular thickening.  Similar changes may be noted along the fissures.  Nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter are actually the result of coalescence of small nodules. Areas of ground glass attenuation can be seen resulting from microscopic interstitial granulomas. CT appearance does not correspond well to patient\u2019s pulmonary state. Sarcoid can lead to end stage fibrosis, which is indistinguishable from other causes.  \nAbdominal involvement includes liver involvement which most commonly produces hepatomegaly, but can result in focal nodules.  Additionally, hypodense splenic nodules can be found.  Intra-abdominal adenopathy can be seen in nearly a 3rd of patients.  Nephrolithiasis can be seen from hypercalcemia. Skeletal findings tend to involve the small bones of the hands with associated skin changes. Findings include a lace-like reticular pattern or cystic lesions. The bone lesions are hot on bone scan and FDG PET imaging. \nCardiac changes can include thinning of the myocardium seen on CT.  On MRI, there can be areas of increased MRI T2 signal intensity and areas of T-1 contrast enhancement.\n\nStaging/prognosis: Staging is based upon the CXR findings. Stage 0- Normal CXR; Stage 1- Mediastinal/ Hilar adenopathy; Stage 2- Adenopathy plus parenchymal infiltrates; Stage 3- Lung infiltrates only; and Stage 4- Fibrosis/ Cystic changes. Prognosis is directly correlated with the patients staging.   Sarcoid will resolve in over half of stage 1 patients.  Overall, about 20% of affected patients will progress to pulmonary fibrosis with 5% mortality.\n\nTreatment: Usually no treatment is necessary. Spontaneous remission occurs in 90% of patients with stage 1 pulmonary disease and half of patients with stage 2.  If chest x-rays showed persistent pulmonary infiltration with associated decreased serial lung functions oral steroids are used.  In patients who are unresponsive to steroids, other medications such as azathioprine or cyclosporin may be useful.   Chloroquine is used as a steroid sparing agent in patients with severe skin disease.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Definition:\n\u2022 Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a highly aggressive B-cell neoplasm characterized by the translocation and deregulation of the c-myc gene, which causes the tumor cells to remain in cycle. This makes the neoplasm morphologically homogenous, but also allows for its oftentimes quick response to chemotherapeutics; it grows quickly and dies quickly.\n\n\nPresentation:\n\u2022  Patients with BL present with rapidly growing tumor masses and often have evidence of tumor lysis with a very high serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentration and elevated uric acid levels. \n\n\u2022 Three distinct clinical forms of BL are recognized: sporadic, endemic, and immunodeficiency-associated.  Although they are histologically identical and have similar clinical behavior, there are differences in epidemiology, clinical presentation, and genetic features between the three forms:\n\n\u00bb\u00bbThe nonendemic (sporadic) form usually has an abdominal presentation, most often with massive disease and ascites, involving the distal ileum, stomach, cecum and/or mesentery, kidney, testis, ovary, breast, bone marrow, or central nervous system. Presenting symptoms can include those related to bowel obstruction or gastrointestinal bleeding, often mimicking acute appendicitis or intussusception. \n\n\u00bb\u00bbThe endemic (African) form usually presents as a jaw or facial bone tumor that spreads to extranodal sites including the mesentery, ovary, testis, kidney, breast, and especially to the bone marrow and meninges.\n\n\u00bb\u00bbImmunodeficiency-related cases more often involve lymph nodes; both these and sporadic cases may present with blood involvement.\n\n\nRadiology: \n\u2022 For lymphomas, CT is usually the primary staging modality in the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis because of its generally superior spatial resolution.\n\n\u2022 CT is typically superior to MRI in the evaluation of subtle bone destruction, if present.\n\n\u2022 MRI has superior tissue resolution, often allowing it to distinguish a small focus of tumor from surrounding normal soft tissue far better than CT.\n\n\nTreatment:\n\u2022 The standard of care for BL has yet to be defined. Aggressive combination chemotherapy with central nervous system (CNS) prophylaxis is often used. As response to chemotherapy is rapid and disease is inevitably diffuse, there is no role for radiation therapy in BL, even in patients with localized disease. In addition, surgery is no longer employed in BL.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Meta-Iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG): Neuroblastoma, ganglioneuro(blasto)ma and pheochromocytoma are tumors derived from the tissues of the sympathetic nervous system.  Structurally MIBG resembles norepinephrine and guanethidine (neurosecretory-depleting agent).  MIBG is taken up into the storage granules of both normal and abnormal neural crest cells.  The uptake is proportional to the number of neurosecretory granules within a tumor.  MIBG uptake is blocked by many drugs.  Catecholamine agonists (phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), antipsychotics (phenothiazines), tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, long acting beta blockers (labetalol), drugs that deplete catocholamine stores (reserpine, guanethidine) and cocaine are examples of drugs that interfere with MIBG uptake.  Radiolabeling is done with I-123 and I-131  (I-123:  half life 13.2 hrs, energy 159 KeV; I-131: half life 8.1 days, energy 364 KeV).  \nI-123 MIBG is used in much larger administration activities because of its much lower absorbed radiation dose per mCi compared with I-131.  In addition, current  gamma camera detection crystals can more efficiently detect the 159 KeV photons.  Collimation is easier at lower energy and I-123 has a higher photon flux at 24 hour imaging.  For these reasons MIBG studies with \n\nI-123 is of considerably higher quality than with I-131.  Normal distribution of  MIBG includes salivary glands, myocardium, liver and urine.  Amount in the GI tract is variable and related to excretion into the gut.  A small percentage of patients show some activity in a blocked thyroid gland, normal adrenals, lung, and skeletal muscle.  In normal subjects, activity should not be seen in bone, bone marrow or spleen.  Utilizing SPECT MIBG can increase certainty of interpretation over planar imaging although it has not shown to increase the number of lesions detected.\nAlthough in this particuar case, the tumor was not identified on planar images but it was visualized on SPECT imaging.   Overall, primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, bone and bone marrow metastasis are detected using MIBG.\n\nPheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of chromaffin cells most commonly arising from the adrenal medulla. An estimated 800 cases are diagnosed yearly in the U.S. The peak incidence is in the third to fifth decades of life. Bilateral disease is present in approximately 10% of patients. Bilaterality is much more common in familial pheochromocytoma, often found in association with the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN, types IIA and IIB). In patients with MEN type II syndromes, the risk of developing a contralateral tumor following unilateral adrenalectomy is approximately 50%. Other syndromes associated with pheochromocytoma include neurofibromatosis, von Hippel-Lindau disease, cerebellar hemangioblastoma, Sturge-Weber\\'s syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis. Therefore, all patients with pheochromocytomas should be screened for MEN-2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease to avert further morbidity and mortality in the patients and their families. Extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma or functional paraganglioma occurs in approximately 10% to 15% of cases and may arise from any extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue in the body associated with sympathetic ganglia. \n\nExtra-adrenal pheochromocytoma is most often located within the abdomen and may have greater malignant potential than adrenal pheochromocytoma.  Extra-adrenal tumors usually have a poorer prognosis than adrenal tumors.  Due to the production and release of catecholamines, pheochromocytomas cause hypertension. However, only 0.1% to 0.5% of all hypertension patients will be found to have a pheochromocytoma. The importance of the recognition of this disease is that over 90% of patients properly diagnosed and treated are curable.\n\nThe hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma may be sustained or paroxysmal and is often severe with occasional malignant features of encephalopathy, retinopathy and proteinuria. Less commonly, severe hypertensive reactions may occur during incidental surgery, following trauma, exercise, or micturition (in the setting of bladder pheochromocytoma) when the diagnosis is unsuspected. Other clinical features of pheochromocytoma include headache, sweating, palpitation, tachycardia and severe anxiety along with epigastric or chest pain. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is established by the demonstration of elevated 24-hour urinary excretion of free catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) or catecholamine metabolites (VMA and total metanephrines). The measurement of plasma catecholamines can also be of value in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. However, the measurement of plasma catecholamines has limited sensitivity and specificity. Plasma metanephrines have been reported to be more sensitive than plasma catecholamines. \n\nOnce the diagnosis is confirmed by biochemical determinations the localization and extent of disease should be determined. Ninety-seven percent are found in the abdomen, 2% to 3% in the thorax, and 1% in the neck. The initial studies should be a chest film and abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan. \n\nI123meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) has been found to be useful as a scintigraphic localization agent. If the tumor is not adequately localized by these methods then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or rarely, vena cava catheterization with selective venous sampling for catecholamines may be indicated. CT and MRI scans are about equally sensitive (98%-100%), while MIBG scanning has a sensitivity of only 80%. However, MIBG scanning has a specificity of 100%, compared to specificity of 70% for CT and MRI.  Surgical resection is the standard curative modality. If the primary tumor is localized to the adrenal gland and is benign, then survival is that of the normal age-matched population. In patients with unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic disease long-term survival is possible however, the overall 5-year survival is less than 50%. Pharmacologic treatment of the catecholamine excess is mandatory and surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may provide palliative benefit.",

            "Title": "Sub-acute thromboembolism of SMA",
            "Disease Discussion": "The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) arises approximately 1 cm below the celiac artery and runs inferiorly toward the cecum, terminating as the ileocolic artery. Along the way, it gives rise to the inferior pancreaticoduodenal artery, several jejunal and ileal branches, the middle colic artery, and the right colic artery.  Complete or partial occlusion of the SMA leads to acute mesenteric ischemia, with a mortality rate of 60-70%.   There are four major causes of acute mesenteric ischemia: 1) SMA embolism (50%); 2) SMA thrombosis (15-25%); 3) Mesenteric venous thrombosis (5%); 4) Nonocclusive ischemia (20 to 30 percent). ,   The SMA is particularly susceptible to embolic events of cardiac origin, due to it\u2019s relatively large caliber, and narrow take-off angle from the descending aorta.   The embolus usually lodges 3 to 10 cm distal to the origin of the SMA, in a tapered segment distal to the take off of the middle colic artery.  In general, the clinical presentation of acute mesenteric ischemia is limited to sudden onset of pain, pain out of proportion to physical findings, and possibly some nausea and/or vomiting.  The laboratory findings are non-specific.  Radiographically, mesenteric angiography remains the gold standard diagnostic study for mesenteric arterial ischemia.  Plain fim radiography of the abdomen is non-specific, and in 25% of all cases, will be normal.   The use of traditional CT (with contrast) for the detection of mesenteric ischemia is limited by the ability of the radiologist to distinguish areas of decreased opacity distal to site of obstruction.  One small study demonstrated a sensitivity of 64% and specificity of 92%.     MRA and Multi detector row CT (MDCT) hold promise as viable tools to evaluate mesenteric arteries, however no comparison studies are available for study.  Angiography therefore remains the gold standard.Treatment of mesenteric arterial embolism, traditionally, has been early surgical laparotomy with embolectomy.  Intra-operative palpation for SMA pulses is performed and the small bowel is carefully examined for areas of persistent ischemia, which are resected.  A \"second look\" laparotomy within the next 24 to 48 hours may be necessary to resect additional ischemic or gangrenous bowel.  A less well-established approach (which was used initially in this case) is local infusion of thrombolytic therapy, which has been successful in a number of reports. , ,  Thrombolytic therapy should only be considered in patients who can undergo angiography within eight hours of the onset of abdominal pain, and who do not have clinical evidence of bowel necrosis or other contraindications to thrombolytic therapy.  Surgical exploration is mandatory in patients who do not demonstrate clot lysis within four hours or develop evidence of progressive ischemia. Despite success in case series, the long-term reocclusion rate after thrombolytic therapy has not been well studied.  Long term treatment is aimed at limiting the chance of recurrence and usually requires the use of Warfarin.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The vascular supply to the liver is widely varied with accessory and replaced arteries frequently demonstrated. To being with, the common hepatic artery usually arises from the celiac trunk (86%).  Other sources include the superior mesenteric artery (2.9%), the aorta (1.1%), and rarely, the left gastric artery. \n\nWhen it originates from the celiac axis, the common hepatic artery runs horizontally along the upper border of the head of the pancreas. The gastroduodenal artery branches off the common hepatic artery posterior and superior to the duodenum. The common hepatic artery then continues as the proper hepatic artery and turns upward to ascend in the hepatoduodenal ligament, in front of the epiploic (Winslow's) foramen. Within the hepatoduodenal ligament, the proper hepatic artery lies to the left of the common bile duct and anterior to the portal vein. Within the ligament the proper hepatic artery divides into the right and left hepatic arteries. Arterial distribution to different functional segments is identical to the distribution of portal vein The right hepatic artery passes to the right behind (or occasionally in front of) the hepatic duct in front of the portal vein. Before entering the liver, the right hepatic artery gives off the cystic artery in the hepatocystic triangle located between the cystic duct and the common bile duct.\n\nAberrant hepatic arteries are found in about 45% of subjects. If the arteries arise entirely from some source other than the celiac arterial distribution, they are called replaced arteries and can supply an entire lobe of the liver or even the entire liver. Atypical hepatic arteries are commonly called accessory arteries if they arise from some aberrant source and are additive to lobar branches. Even so, it should be noted that they often provide the primary arterial supply to a specific portion of the liver and therefore are not accessory arteries. These aberrant hepatic arteries should be distinguished from segmental arteries arising outside the liver.\n \nThe most common occurrences of aberrant hepatic arteries involve , the left hepatic artery arising from the left gastric artery, which comprises 25-30% of instances. In about 17% of cases, the right hepatic artery branches from the superior mesenteric artery (as in this patient).",

            "Disease Discussion": "Osteopetrosis is a family of rare bone disorders caused by dysfunctional osteoclasts.  \n\nFrequently, a spectrum of skeletal abnormalities are seen leading to at least four types (Precocious Type i.e. autosomal recessive, Delyaed Type i.e. autosomal dominant,  Intermediate Recessive Type, and Tubular Acidosis Type), characterized by a generalized increase in the density of bone.  Because of osteoclast dysfunction, bone remodeling is impaired and the primary calcified substantia spongiosa ossium is not reabsorbed.  Eventually, the normal marrow spaces may become obliterated, resulting in pancytopenia.\n\nTwo modes of genetic transmission have been described: autosomal recessive and autosomal dominant.  Autosomal recessive is associated with worse outcomes, as most patient\u2019s die from infection or bone marrow failure before adolescence.  The autosomal dominant form is frequently discovered incidentally in adulthood with benign outcomes. \n\nClinical presentations for the autosomal recessive form include failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, severe anemia, and cranial nerve dysfunction.  Progressive loss of the normal marrow leads to pancytopenia and predisposes to recurrent infection.  Other associations include renal tubular acidosis and neuronal storage diseases.  \n\nVarious synonyms include: Albers-Schonberg disease, osteosclerosis, osteopetrosis generalisata, and marble bones disease. \n\nPrecocious Type: Radiographic findings are characterized by generalized osteosclerosis.  Tubular bones demonstrate a failure of differentiation between the cortex and medullary cavity.  A bone within bone appearance may be seen.\n\nDelayed Type: May be detected because of a pathologic fracture.  The radiographic findings are similar to the autosomal recessive form. Bones are diffusely osteosclerotic, with defective tubulation and a thickened cortex.  The vertebral endplates are accentuated, producing a \u201csandwich\u201d vertebra appearace in children, and a \u201crugger-jersey\u201d spine may be seen in adults. A bone within bone appearance is frequently seen.\n\nIntermediate Recessive Type: Short stature patients, with pathologic fractures, anemia, and hepatomegaly, characterized by diffuse bone sclerosis, bone within bone appearance, and retained primary and impaced permanent teeth.  Ischemic necrosis of the femoral head has been reported.\n\nTubular Acidosis Type: \u201cMarble Brain\u201d or \u201cSly disease\u201d consists of osteopetrosis, renal tubular acidosis, and cerebral calcifications.  Radiographic findings include osteosclerosis, loss of the medullary cavity, and pathologic fractures.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Hepatocellular carcinoma, or hepatoma, refers to a malignant lesion originating in the liver parenchymal cells. The most significant risk factors for development of HCC include cirrhosis and hepatitis B or C infection. Other less common risk factors include hemochromatosis, aflatoxin exposure and alpha-1-antiprotease deficiency.\n\nClinical presentation: Patients often present with cachexia, weakness, right upper quadrant pain, and weight loss. HCC should be suspected in previously stable cirrhosis patients who experience a sudden deterioration in their condition.\n\nPhysical examination: The physician may find an enlarged and tender liver, palpable mass, and bruit or friction rub.\n\nLaboratory: A sudden and sustained elevation in AFP is suggestive of HCC.\n\nRadiographic evaluation:\n\n\tCT: HCC can present as a solitary mass, multiple masses with a dominant lesion and satellites or as a diffusely infiltrating neoplasm. The masses can be characterized as areas of low attenuation. Ten percent of tumors will show calcification. Dual phase imaging in arterial and portal venous phases may be necessary to detect the tumor. These tumors commonly invade blood vessels such as portal and hepatic veins. Portal vein thrombosis appears as regional wedge-like shapes of low density that project peripherally. Tumor thrombus will enhance on arterial phase CT images.\n\n\tMRI: MRI findings depend on the amount of fibrosis and necrosis in the liver. HCC can be recognized as low-signal intensity on T1 with an increase in signal intensity on T2. MR demonstrates vascular involvement well.\n\n\tUS: HCC appears as mosaic pattern, peripheral sonolucency with lateral shadow due to fibrotic pseudocapsule, posterior acoustic enhancement. Along with AFP levels, ultrasound is used as a screening tool in patients with a history of cirrhosis.\n\n\nPatient presented in this case is an 81 year old woman who was originally diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in 2001.

They can occur anywhere along the route of descent of the thyroglossal duct. Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most common congenital neck lesion, being three times as common as branchial cleft cyst.\n\nThyroglossal duct cysts most commonly present at a doughy compressible painless neck mass along the midline or paramedian in a child or young adult. 90% present at less than 10 years of age. Other signs and symptoms include recurrent appearance of neck mass with upper respiratory tract infections or trauma.  Often, the patient will have a history of multiple prior incision & drainage procedures for \u201cneck abcess\u201d.  A rapidly enlarging mass suggests either infection of associated differentiated thyroid carcinoma.  Any associated nodularity or chunky calcification suggests associated thyroid carcinoma.\n\nA thyroglossal duct cyst presents as a midline cystic neck mass imbedded within the infrahyoid strap muscles, \u201cclaw sign\u201d. 50% of the time they are found at the level of the hyoid bone, 25% on the infrahyoid neck and 25% timed at the suprahyoid neck. There usually to 2-4 cm in size and are round or ovoid. On contrast-enhanced CT it appears low density mass, occasionally with internal septations and a thin rim of peripheral enhancement. They are anechoic on ultrasound evaluation.\n\nREFERENCES: \n\nDedivitis RA, et al. Thyroglossal duct: A review of 55 cases. J Am Coll Surg. 194(3):274-7, 2002.\n\nReede DL, et al.

            "Title": "Malignant Melanoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Cutaneous melanoma is readily curable-85% of diagnosed patients will enjoy survival following surgical excision.  Unfortunately, this prognosis cannot be offered to those with metastatic disease.  Overall, the median survival is six to nine months, but in the subset of patients with bone metastases, the survival is only four months.  Bone metastasis is usually a late occurrence is the course of the disease.    \n\nEtiology and Pathogenesis:  \nMelanoma can be broadly divided into two categories: sporadic (90 %) and familial (10 %).  As is true with most neoplasms the cause is multifactorial.  A host of environmental and genetic factors combine in synergy to produce unregulated cell proliferation.  In the case of sporadic melanoma, exposure to ultraviolet B (290 to 320 nm) and ultraviolet A (320 to 400 nm) is the most significant environmental factor.  The most influential genetic component of this disease is a deletion or mutation in the p16INK4 gene.  Normally, this protein regulates cell proliferation by inhibiting the assembly of cyclin D/CDK 4/6 complex.   This genetic error occurs in 25 to 40 percent of sporadic melanomas. Other risk factors include, in decreasing order: past history of melanoma; family history of melanoma or dysplastic nevus; presence of large congenital nevi; presence of ten or greater dysplastic nevi; presence of 100 or greater common acquired nevi; fair skin; red hair; and high intermittent sun exposure. \n\nMalignant melanoma is the final lesion in a series of premalignant lesions that follow a predictable pattern of progression.  First, a normal melanocyte escapes keratinocyte control and becomes a nevus cell.  Next, the cell separates from the basement membrane and demonstrates cytologic atypia, thus becoming a dysplastic nevus cell.  Subsequently, the cell exhibits a radial growth phase, followed by a vertical growth phase.  The Breslow Depth (0.76 mm) is the most reliable predictor of the behavior of the primary lesion, so that the likelihood of metastatic transformation increases with the depth of vertical growth.  The ability to spread to distant sites is a function of the b3 subunit of the vitronectin receptor.\n\nEpidemiology: \nLancaster is credited with discovering a relationship between melanoma incidence and latitude.  As the distance to the equator decreases, the incidence and rate of melanoma mortality in whites increases.  Interestingly, there are 30 cases per 100,000 people in Australia.  Australia exhibits the highest melanoma incidence in the world because of its equatorial climate, fair-skinned population, and ozone depletion.  In the United States, the incidence has increased from 1 per 100,000 in 1935 to 15 per 100,000 in 1996.  In 1973, the mortality was 1.6 per 100,000 individuals; in 1996, the mortality rate was 2.3 per 100,000 individuals.  At present, melanoma ranks as the sixth most common cancer in American men, and the seventh most common cancer among American women.  The risk for developing melanoma among white Americans is 1 in 85.\n\nClinical Manifestations:\nCutaneous melanoma is distinguished by its asymmetry, diffuse borders, variegated color, diameter greater than 5 mm, and evolving morphology.  Ten percent of lesions ulcerate and bleed.  In a study of 84,000 with melanoma, 2.2% of all melanoma presented without signs of a primary lesion (Chang, Cancer 1998; 83: 1664).  These patients are usually younger than other melanoma patients, and they tend to be male.  The prognosis is similar to that of patients with known primary cutaneous melanoma.  The most common sites for metastasis are skin, lungs, liver, brain, and bone.\t\nBrain metastases are present in 8% to 46% of melanoma patients.\n\nDiagnosis:  \nLymph node core biopsy with subsequent immunohistochemical analysis provides a definitive diagnosis.  Ninety percent of melanomas are positive for S-100 antigen.  HMB-45 (Melanoma Associated Marker) is more specific for melanoma than S-100, but it is less sensitive.  Melanoma cells do not exhibit cytokeratin, leukocyte common antigen, or desmin.  \n\nTreatment:\nAt present, there is no cure for disseminated melanoma (Stage IV: M1).   Because brain metastases cause symptoms via compression of neural parenchyma, all therapy is geared toward reducing intracranial pressure.  This can be achieved via corticosteroids, gamma knife irradiation or conventional surgery (in the case of a solitary brain lesion), and/or whole brain radiotherapy (in the case of multiple lesions).  The pain associated with bone metastases is successfully treated by radiotherapy.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The inner (or \"meningeal\") layer of dura contributes to the formation of the falx cerebri, tentorium, and falx cerebelli.  SDHs are to be anticipated along these structures since there is a continuation of the potential subdural space along these dural reflections.  Interhemispheric fissure and tentorial leaf SDHs are commonly seen in elderly trauma victims, especially if they are alcoholic.  The enlarged subarachnoid spaces of these patients may contribute to an excessive mobility of the brain and greater susceptibility of the interhemispheric/tentorial veins to traumatic injury.  \n\nAcute subdural hematomas can be classified as \"simple\" or \"complicated,\" depending on whether parenchymal brain injuries (contusions, intracerebral hematomas, diffuse axonal injury) are also present.  Notably, intra-axial injuries are much more common with acute SDHs than with either EDHs or chronic SDHs.  The majority of patients with acute SDHs, in fact, will have associated parenchymal brain injuries.  Secondary forms of brain injury (anoxic/ischemic injury, trans-tentorial/subfalcine/tonsilar herniation, increased intracranial pressure) are also quite common in patients with acute SDHs. \n\nAcute SDHs still carry a significant risk of morbidity and mortality.  The overall mortality of patients with acute SDHs is greater than that for any other traumatic intracranial mass lesion (ICH, EDH, focal contusion).  Despite modern therapy, the mortality is over 35% in all large series and greater than 50% in most reports.  A primary factor related to clinical outcome of patients with acute SDHs is the presence or absence of associated intraaxial lesions.  In one series of patients, the mortality of \"simple\" SDHs was 22% as compared to over 50% for those with \"complicated\" SDHs.  A second major factor significantly related to outcome is the presence and severity of mass effect.  Mass effect from a SDH may be due to a combination of factors; the hematoma itself, underlying parenchymal injury, intracerebral hematoma, and diffuse cerebral edema/swelling from a loss of vasomotor autoregulation.  The mass effect can produce injury to the brain through a generalized increase in intracranial pressure, global or localized impairment of blood flow, transtentorial/tonsilar herniation resulting in ischemic/pressure necrosis of the upper brain stem.  Other factors directly related to a poor outcome are; greater age of the patient, low Glasgow Coma Scores at the time of operation, bilateral lesions, rapid rate of SDH accumulation, and delayed surgical evacuation (> 4 hours) of the SDH.",

            "Title": "Intracerebral hemorrhage, chronic hypertension",
            "Disease Discussion": "Chronic hypertension causes fibrinoid necrosis in the penetrating and subcortical arteries, weakening of the arterial walls, and formation of small aneurysmal outpouchings, known as Charcot-Bouchard microaneurysms.  These microaneurysms, predispose the patient to spontaneous ICH.  Bleeding is limited by the resistance of tissue pressure in the surrounding brain structures.  If the hematoma is large, distortion of structures and increased ICP may cause headache, vomiting, and decreased alertness. ICH accounts for 10 to 15 percent of all strokes in whites and about 30 percent in blacks and individuals of Asian origin.\n\nLocations of hypertensive ICHs are putamen (40%), lobar (22%), thalamus (15%), pons (8%), cerebellum (8%), and caudate (7%).\n\nThe differential diagnosis should include hypertension, bleeding diatheses (especially as a result of iatrogenic coumadin), trauma (subdural and epidural hematomas), and amyloid angiopathy as the most frequent causes.  Rarely, brain tumors and abscesses can have a rapid onset mimicking ICH.\n\nIn young, normotensive patients, especially those with lobar and intraventricular hemorrhages, vascular malformations (AVM) are the most likely source of bleeding.  \n\nSome primary and metastatic brain tumors, especially renal carcinoma and choriocarcinoma, can develop hemorrhages within the tumor.  The initial evaluation, should include CBC, chemistries, coagulation studies (PT, PTT, bleeding time, and platelet count), arterial blood gas analysis, and toxicology screen.\n\nCT scan should be performed immediately in patients suspected of having an ICH.  Follow-up CT should be performed to evaluate a change in clinical signs or mental status.\n\nPatients who have ICH after cocaine use have a high likelihood of vascular malformations and aneurysms and need angiography.Medical management involves reduction and maintenance of intracranial pressure.  Commonly, patients are intubated if they are unable to protect their airway.  Blood pressure swings may be controlled with IV labetolol (adequate intracranial perfusion pressure must be maintained).  As an adjunct, patients may be placed in the reverse-Trendelenberg position to assist in relieving increased intracranial pressure.\n\nRecent studies of hematoma removal have shown promise for open surgical decompression, but only if accomplished early after the onset of symptoms.  The best candidates for surgery may be patients with moderate to large hematomas who are still awake.  Neuroimaging techniques have made it possible to drain hematomas percutaneously, using stereotactic surgery. Survival depends on the location, size, and rapidity of development of the hematoma.  ICHs are at first soft and dissect along white matter fiber tracts.\n\nIf the patient survives the initial changes in ICP, blood is absorbed and a cavity or slit forms that may interrupt brain pathways.  Patients with small hematomas located deep and near midline structures often develop secondary herniation and mass effect, and these patients have a high mortality rate.  Survivors invariably have severe neurological deficits.  In patients with medium-sized hematomas, the deficit varies with the location and size of the hematomas.",

Mafee, MD \n\nDISCUSSION:\t\nThe membranous labyrinth or cavity consists of the cochlear aqueduct, the vestibular organ, the endolymphatic duct and sac, the round window membrane, and their associated vasculature.  The bony labyrinth includes the vestibule, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea.  The membranous labyrinth of the inner ear begins to form during the early months of gestation.  By mid-term, the mesenchyme that surrounds the labyrinth has transformed into cartilage, and begins to ossify.  The endolymphatic duct and sac are the only portions that grow after birth, and they continue to enlarge until sometime after puberty.\n\nThere is considerable controversy concerning the origin of these slowly growing, yet highly destructive lesions of the temporal bone.  Several recent reports have emphasized that these tumors probably do arise from the epithelial elements lining the endolymphatic system (especially the sac).  The most common presentation is hearing loss, facial nerve palsy, and vestibular dysfunction. \n\nThere appear to be at least 2 categories of this lesion, a slowly growing, relatively benign adenomatous tumor, and a more aggressive lesion with a capillary configuration.  The papillary lesions probably arise within the posterior aspects of the petrous bone in the retrolabyrinthine region.  The lesions may be hypervascular, supplied by  branches of the external carotid artery, and may contain blood products that produce characteristic regions of hyperintensity on T1WI and hypointensity on T2WI.  Intratumoral calcifications within these lesions may represent \"bone sequestra\" produced when the tumor infiltrates into the petrous bone.  Because these lesions may be surrounded by a thin shell of reactive bone, it has been suggested that at least during some portion of their growth, they may expand relatively slowly.  The lesions almost invariably show contrast enhancement.  Some of the tumors have a speckled pattern of hyperintensity on T1WI, which can mimic the appearance of other vascular lesions of the petrous apex, including glomus tumors.\n\nThe papillary endolymphatic sac tumor has been associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL)and may present with bilateral papillary endolymphatic sac neoplasms.  It is also interesting to remember that patients with VHL may develop cystadenomas in the testis and in relationship to the female pelvic adnexa.  \n\nIn this patient, the differential diagnosis could include chondroid lesions (benign chondroma as well as low-grade chondrosarcoma, and chondromyxoid fibroma), cholesterol granuloma, metastatic disease, and possibly an aggressive epidermoid cyst.\n\nBecause the histology of this lesion may be confusing to surgical pathologists, an accurate preoperative localization by neuroimaging can assist in suggesting the correct diagnosis.  The prognosis can be quite good after careful gross removal of the lesion.  However, incomplete resection is associated with recurrence.\n\nSUGGESTED READINGS:\n\nBatsakis, J.G. and el-Naggar, A.K.

            "Disease Discussion": "Parosteal Osteosarcoma (Juxtacortical Osteosarcoma) is an uncommon tumor that is found in a somewhat older age group than osteosarcoma, ranging from 15-50 years of age (median age of 27), and it is more commonly found in women. It accounts for 4% of all osteogenic sarcomas. The classic location for a parosteal osteosarcoma is the posterior distal metaphysis of the femur; however, it may also arise in the posterior metaphysis of the proximal tibia and the proximal metaphysis of the humerus, and rarely elsewhere. It is slow-growing but has a tendency to recur after inadequate excision, and it may metastasize. The lesion arises from the outer fibrous layer of periosteum. Common presenting symptoms are aching or limited range of motion due to interference with a joint. \n\nThe tumor merges with the cortex by a stalk early on in the disease process and has a broad base later on in the progression. The bone marrow of the bone does not extend into the base of the tumor. Although, there may be occasional medullary involvement by the tumor.  Radiographically it is a broad-based, juxtacortical, densely ossified mass, the periphery somewhat less dense that the base. CT scan is most useful and can demonstrate a radiolucent zone of periosteum and fibrous tissue trapped between the tumor and cortex. The lesion may consist of three layers: at the cortical surface it is dense and compact, it has a middle layer of amorphous dense bone, and the outer layer there are dense spicules extending into the periphery. These tumors typically have a low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and a high signal intensity on T2-weighted images.  The lesion may eventually progress to cortical destruction and medullary invasion, MRI can be used to grade the extent of tumor extension and cortical disruption.\n\nDifferential diagnosis should include; myositis ossificans, osteochondroma and periosteal sarcoma. Myositis ossificans is more densely calcified at its periphery and usually does not involve the adjacent cortex. With an osteochondroma the stalk of an exostosis is contiguous with the cortex of the bone from which it arises and the medullary bone within the stalk is also contiguous with that of the adjacent bone. Chondroid calcification within the cartilaginous cap may be present and is also distinctive.\n\nParosteal osteosarcoma has a relatively good prognosis compared to conventional osteosarcoma. Wide excision is the preferred treatment and there is normally no role for chemotherapy.",

Ivory vertebrae can represent osteoblastic metastatic disease, commonly stemming from breast cancer (as in this case), or carcinoma of the prostate.  This finding can also be associated with Paget disease, lymphoma, and less commonly with osteosarcoma and carcinoid.  This finding is much less common in children and usually related to Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma.  \n\nIvory vertebra appears as a  uniformly white vertebra with no abnormality of its contour or adjacent disks. The vertebra stands out against the adjacent normal, or darker, vertebral bodies. \n\nOsteoblastic metastases and lymphoma both result in the replacement of the vertebral body spongiosa with dense, confluent bony mass.  This produces a homogenous sclerotic appearance.  Paget disease often causes expansion of the vertebral body, disrupting the external contours.  \n\nReferences:\n\nGraham TS. The Ivory Vertebra Sign.

However, the differential diagnosis for this finding includes lymphoma or treated lytic mets, and rarely, chordoma, plasmacytoma, or Paget disease. This appearance should be differentiated from the corduroy vertebral body (accentuated vertical striations) of an hemangioma, The rugger jersey vertebral body (radiodense stripes at the top and bottom of the vertebra) of renal osteodystrophy, the picture frame vertebral body (condensation of bone along the margins of the vertebral body) of Paget disease, and the sandwich vertebral body (extreme and uniform increase in radiodensity along the inferior and superior margins of the vertebral body) of osteopetrosis.\n\nPedicle involvement is one clue to the cause of a sclerotic vertebral body.  Destruction of one or both pedicles is a well known result of metastatic disease that is rarely present in the case of plasmacytoma.  Keep in mind, though, that this finding is typically a result of extension of the tumor deposit into the pedicle from the posterior vertebral body, rather than primary deposition into the pedicle.  \n\nPreservation of disc space and vertebral body size are another important indicator of the nature of a sclerotic vertebral body.  Indolent infection such as TB commonly produces end plate destruction, disc space narrowing, and paraspinal soft tissue mass.\n\nPaget disease of  the vertebral body may be difficult to separate from neoplastic causes because it usually involves a single vertebral body.  The classic appearance includes an expanded body with thickened cortex and coarsened trabeculation, with preservation of the disc space.",

Anomalous drainage of the right pulmonary vein to the inferior vena cava (scimitar syndrome) can present as a left to right shunt in patients with volume loss of the right hemithorax and a peculiar comma shaped density in the right lung base.  Anomalous drainage of the right upper lobe is associated with a sinus venosus type of atrial septal defect.  Left lower lobe pulmonary systemic drainage is associated with extralobar sequestration.\t\n\tWhen the left upper lobe vein drains into the left brachiocephalic vein, a vertical vein is seen coursing lateral to the aortic arch and the AP window.

One is consistent with PAPVR while two indicates persistent left SVC (one vessel is svc other is normal left upper lobe vein.\n\tA persistent left SVC occurs in about 0.3% of the normal population with a substantially higher incidence in patients with congenital heart disease.  This anomaly results from embryologic failure of regression of part of the left common and anterior cardinal veins.  It at least drains the left jugular and subclavian veins.  On CT a persistent left SVC is positioned immediately lateral to the left common carotid artery and anterior to the left subclavian artery.  The anomalous vessel descends lateral to the aortic arch, in approximately the same coronal plane as the normal right SVC.  It passes lateral to the main pulmonary artery and anterior to the left hilum.  It typically drains into a dilated coronary sinus posterior to the left ventricle.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Decompressive craniectomy is a neurosurgical procedure aimed at relieving elevated intra-cranial pressure (ICP) by removing the patient\u2019s rigid skull1.  Decompressive craniectomy is a surgical option for the treatment of ICP in cases where medical management fails and in acute severe traumatic brain injury. The surgery alone has been shown to reduce ICP by 15% and up to 70% if the surgeon opens the dura2.  More than 40,000 cranial surgeries are performed in the United States each year.  The most frequent principle diagnosis in patients receiving such surgeries is subdural hemorrhage3.  \n   Upon resolution of the intra-cranial hypertension, a cranioplasty is performed to close the hole in the skull.  There are a number of suitable materials that can be used for this purpose and one of the more common materials is the patient\u2019s own bone flap (removed segment of skull).  This option is cost-effective, strong, immunologically compatible with the host, and yields the best cosmetic result.  \n   Several techniques for preserving the bone flap exist to include freezing, placement in storage solutions, and placement in the subcutaneous tissue of the patient\u2019s abdominal wall.  Placement in the patient\u2019s abdominal wall minimizes the risk of plate loss and maintains the sterility of the plate.  Additionally, host bone contains osteoinductive factors which stimulate the maturation of chondroblasts and osteoblasts.  Freezing, irradiation, and storage solutions inactivate these factors leading to bone resorption and impaired healing.  Placing the bone flap in the abdominal wall allows these factors to remain active and eliminates bone resorption1.",

The are the most common type of neuroendocrine tumors with an estimated 1.5 clinical cases per 100,000.  Autopsy case incidence is higher at 650 per 100,000.  \n \nOver 2/3 of carcinoid tumors are in the GI tract, but can also occur in lungs, ovaries, testes, mediastinum, kidneys, etc.  More than 95% of GI carcinoids originate in only 3 sites: appendix, ileum, and rectum.  Carcinoids are most often benign, but those affecting the ileum and bronchus are frequently malignant.  \n\nCLINICAL FEATURES: \nSigns and symptoms vary depending on size, location, and metastases.  Most tumors are slow growing and asymptomatic until late disease.  Metastatic disease can occur but is not common.  Carcinoid tumors can be endocrinologically inert or secrete several hormones (serotonin, histamine, kallikrein, insulin, etc) which are responsible for carcinoid syndrome (cutaneous flushing, venous telangiectasia, diarrhea, bronchospasm, cardiac valvular lesions).   \n\nDIAGNOSIS: \nMany carcinoid tumors are found incidentally on endoscopic or radiographic procedures.  The most useful test for carcinoid syndrome is to measure 24-hour urinary excretion of 5-HIAA.  Once the diagnosis has been confirmed, the tumor must be localized using abdominal CT and indium-111 octreotide imaging.  If metastases are suspected, then use of CT or MRI is recommended to rule out liver metastases.\n\nCOMPLICATIONS:\nCarcinoid crisis - life threatening form of carcinoid syndrome that results from the release of extremely high amounts of biologically active compounds (catecholamines, etc) from the tumor.  Symptoms include flushing, diarrhea, tachycardia, arrhythmias, blood pressure fluctuation, bronchospasm, and altered mental status.\n\nMANAGEMENT:\nLocalize tumor and metastases by CT and somatostatin receptor scintigraphy.  Remove tumor if it has not metastasized.  Control carcinoid symptoms (octreotide for flushing and/or diarrhea).",

If the catheter cannot be positioned distal to the origin of the spinal artery, embolization should not be performed. \n\nSecond, coils should not be used for embolization. The hemostasis required is at the capillary level. Placing a large, proximal coil will not treat the abnormal vessels, which will recruit proximal supply via other ICBT collaterals."

The fusion occurs at the lower poles in 90% of the cases, while 10% are fused at the upper pole.  This anomaly is found in approximately 1/500-100 people.  It is thought that the abnormal fusion likely occurs when the kidneys are still in the pelvis and the renal capsule is not fully developed.  During the kidneys ascent these fused kidneys are trapped by the inferior mesenteric artery as the isthmus is unable to pass.  The kidneys ascend to their normal positions between the fourth and ninth weeks of gestation.  Complications include: ureteropelvic junction obstruction, recurrent UTI (urine stasis and vesicoureteric reflux), recurrent stone formation, and increased risk of trauma (due to kidney positioning). Horseshoe kidney may occur as an isolated anomaly or associated with other anomalies.  Associated anomalies may include: ureteral duplication, hypospadias, undescended testis, ectopic ureter, anorectal malformations, GI malrotation, Meckel\u2019s diverticulum, neural tube defects, clubfoot, congenital hip dislocation, and ventricular septal defect.  Chromosomal abnormalities have also been associated with horseshoe kidney.  Horseshoe kidney is often evaluated with intravenous urography, CT, and/or ultrasound.

            "Title": "Adrenal Myelolipoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Adrenal myelolipoma is a benign neoplasm composed of adipose tissue and hematopoietic elements that are usually small and asymptomatic. These tumors are generally discovered incidentally at autopsy or imaging studies performed for other reasons (0.08-0.2% at autopsy). Extra-adrenal sites include the pelvis, thorax and retroperitoneum. They are typically unilateral and variable in size from mm to 30cm. There is an equal incidence in males and females with slight predilection in the Caucasian population. These neoplasms typically occur in the fifth to seventh decades, and no death rate is reported in the literature due to the rarity of these tumors. \n\nCT is the imaging modality of choice for these lesions which can be diagnosed macroscopically by focal fatty density within the mass. Occasionally, discrete calcifications can be found in small amounts along with a thin rim of residual adrenal cortex. MRI can also accurately depict both microscopic and macroscopic fat through chemical shift imaging and explicit fat saturation technique. Ultrasound is typically not used for the characterization of adrenal neoplasms, but has been known to find them incidentally. \n\nIt is believed that these tumors might represent an extramedullary site of hematopoiesis or that they arise from metaplasia of the reticuloendothelial cells of capillaries in the adrenal gland in response to stimuli (ie. necrosis, infection, stress). \n\nThese lesions are usually asymptomatic but might result in complications such as rupture (rare-only 11 reported cases as of 2003), tumor necrosis and retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and mechanical compression from tumor bulk. Myelolipomas do not undergo malignant transformation and they are rarely associated with endocrine disorders. However, Conn\u2019s and Cushing\u2019s syndromes as well as congenital adrenal hyperplasia have been documented in the literature (25 cases reported by one study). \n\nSmall asymptomatic tumors are generally monitored clinically while symptomatic lesions are treated by adrenalectomy. Large asymptomatic tumors are occasionally removed surgically to prevent rupture, and transcatheter embolization is used prior to surgery to stop bleeding of ruptured tumors. As most adrenal myelolipomas are small, asymptomatic, and discovered incidentally, surgery is rarely required.",

Had the bleeding vessel not been occluded by transcatheter embolization, this patient would have had to undergo two operations: one to resect the bowel and one to reanastomose his ostomy.  Because this microcoil embolization procedure was successful, the patient received a bowel prep before his resection, which allowed him to undergo a single operation instead of two operations.  Thus, in addition to stopping this patient's hemorrhage, this embolization procedure decreased this patient's risk of surgery- and anesthesia-related morbidity and mortality."

            "Disease Discussion": "A lower gastrointestinal bleed (LGIB) is hemorrhage distal to the ligament of Treitz and includes hemorrhage of the small bowel and colon.  Common etiologies include diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, neoplasm, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [1].  The most common etiology in patients over 50 is diverticulosis, while the most common etiology in young patients is IBD [1].  Infection is the most common etiology in immunocompromised hosts [1].\n\n     Acute lower gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a potentially life threatening condition.  Although most cases can be managed medically, 10-15% require intervention to control the hemorrhage [2].  Therapeutic options include surgery, vasopressin infusion, endoscopy, and transcatheter embolization.  Surgery is associated with mortality rates as high as 15-30% in emergent operations, and vasopressin is associated with high rates of rebleeding and systemic side effects [2].  Although colonoscopy has become first line in the investigation and treatment of lower GI hemorrhage, endoscopy is limited in cases of massive hemorrhage because the presence of copious amounts of blood and stool in the bowel may prevent visualization of a bleeding source [2].  Given a positive dynamic bleeding scan, mesenteric angiography becomes important not only because it localizes active bleeding, but also because it provides a pathway for potential treatment [2].  Modern transcatheter embolotherapy has become an option in the the management of lower GI hemorrhage, and microcoils are the preferred embolic agent for many interventionalists [2].\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nTable 1.

Note the graph shows the total number of ischemic complications in each study, as well as the number of clinically significant complications, defined here as those necessitating surgical therapy or causing major morbidity or death.  Numbers in parentheses are percentages.  Asterisks indicate studies in which microcoils were the only agents of embolization.  It is interesting to note that studies from the 1980s (not charted) demonstrate a 20% incidence of clinically significant postembolization infarction, whereas these later studies demonstrate no or few cases of postembolization infarction [2].  It is reasonable to suspect that this difference is a result of the advent of finer coaxial systems and microcoils, which have enabled more distal and selective catheterization and embolization.\n\n     Embolization may not be possible in all patients in whom bleeding is identified at angiographic examination because of several factors.  These factors include vessel spasm, spontaneous cessation of bleeding, and vessel tortuosity [7].  Technical failure caused by these factors occurs in approximately 20% of cases at Naval Medical Center San Diego, which is similar to rates reported in the literature [2],[7].",

The differential considerations for a splenic cyst include post-traumatic, epidermoid cyst, abscess, hydatid cyst, infarction, splenic peliosis, and neoplasia, both benign and malignant.  80% of cases in North America are post-traumatic.  Direct surgical intervention in this case yielded a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst, as defined by the presence of an inner endothelial lining.\n\nSplenic cysts can remain stable in size for many years, or enlarge slowly, occasionally to massive proportion (as was the case with this patient).  The potential for rupture and hemorrhage increases with increasing size.  There is also a risk for secondary infection.  Optimal surgical management is not clearly defined, but a number of procedures are available for symptomatic or enlarging cysts.  Available options for those with non-parasitic cysts include percutaneous procedures (eg, biopsy, aspiration, drainage), or more direct surgical interventions such as decapsulation/cyst wall unroofing, partial or total splenectomy.  However, only splenectomy provides diagnostic certainty, which is rarely clinically justified.   \n\nReferences:\n\nUrrutia M, Mergo PJ, Ros LH, et al.

Patients usually present between 30-50 years of ages.  They are most commonly located in the posterior mandible and ramus.  When they occur in the maxilla, these locally aggressive tumors can extend into the nasal cavity and skull base.\n\nClinically, ameloblastomas are the most aggressive of the odontogenic tumors and can cause large facial deformities.  These lesions characteristically have a soap bubble appearance (multiloculated) with sharply-defined margins, although more aggressive features of cortical disruption and soft tissue extension are possible findings.\n\nAmeloblastomas can also have a unilocular appearance and may then be confused with odontogenic cysts.  Most are not associated with tooth impaction, but can be associated with displacement or resorption of adjacent teeth.\n\nStandard treatment involves en bloc resection or curretage for mandibular lesions and resection for maxillary ameloblastomas.  Rarely they may have malignant transformation and metastatic potential; and, the recurrence rate is relatively high after treatment (20%); patients are generally followed postoperatively for a period of 5 years.",

Secondary torsion is more common, and is usually associated with cysts, tumors, foci of intraabdominal inflammation, postsurgical scarring, or hernia sacs.\n\nClinically, this is rarely diagnosed prior to surgery.  It usually presents suddenly with signs of peritoneal irritation in the affected area of the abdomen.  Patients may experience nausea, vomiting, or low-grade fever.  Two thirds of patients have mild leukocytosis.  Half of patients have a palpable mass.

            "Disease Discussion": "RADIOLOGICAL FINDINGS: The visualized mediastinum is noteworthy for aneurysmal dilatation of the aortic root which appears to involve all three cusps. If the cusps are included in the measurement, this dilation measures approximately 6.8 cm in transverse dimensions x 5.7 cm in AP dimensions.  If the cusps are not included in the measurement, the aortic root measures approximately 5.2 cm transverse x 5.8 cm in maximum  AP dimension. Dilation of the cardiac silhouette is noted compatible with cardiomegaly\n\nDIAGNOSIS: 1. Aneurysmal dilation of the aortic root suspicious for sinus of Valsalva aneurysm as described above. 2.Cardiomegaly\n\nDIFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Ascending Aortic Aneurysm secondary to syphilis, Dilation of the aortic root secondary to conective tissue diseases including Marfan\u2019s Syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Trauma, or Dissection.\n\nDISCUSSION: Aneurysms of the thoracic aorta are classified by location with the most common being the descending portion of the aorta. The ascending portion of the aorta is the second most common with aneurysms of the arch of the aorta being the most rare. \nCauses for thoracic aortic aneurysms usually consist of cystic medial necrosis. This may be a result of connective tissue disorders such as Marfan\u2019s syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Other causes can include athersclerotic vascular disease, syphilis, infectious aortitis, trauma, and dissection. \nThere are a wide range of signs and symptoms associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms. Most problems associated with this disease entity are cardio-vascular in nature. This includes congestive heart failure, continuous murmur, and thromboembolism. If the aneurysm is large enough superior vena cava syndrome may occur secondary to mass affect. It has been reported that up to forty percent of patients with aneurysms involving the thoracic aorta are asymptomatic at incidental diagnosis.  \nThere are multiple diagnostic modalities that may be used in the diagnosis of thoracic aortic aneurysms. The gold standard is aortography. Contrast enhanced CT may be used as well. MRI and MRA have been particularly useful in defining vascular anatomy. Trans-thoracic echocardiography has limited accuracy in diagnosis of aneurysms, but trans-esophogeal echocardiography is quite accurate. \nTreatment consists of surgery and is recommended if the ascending thoracic aorta is 5.5 cm or greater. The Bentall procedure is usually performed. It consists of grafting in a Dacron tube with a prosthetic aortic valve. If surgery is not performed patients have a 32 to 68 percent chance of rupture. \n\nREFERENCES:\nBraunwald: Heart Disease: A Textbook of Cardiovascular Medicine, 6th ed., Copyright \u00a9 2001 W. B.

            "Disease Discussion": "Although relatively rare, juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM) can be a catastrophic diagnosis.  It is closely related to juvenile polymyositis (JPM) which does not present with a heliotrophic facial rash. JDM is an autoimmune disorder in which B lymphocytes and completment are noted in the perivascular areas of the soft tissue, while in JPM the CD8+ T lymphocytes predominate.\n\nJDM seems to have some genetic predisposition and has been shown to have a seasonal increase in the spring and summer months.  It is associated with Coxsachie B antibodies in children.  Another reported association occurs between echovirus and chronic polymyositis. \n\nSigns and symptoms of the disease include viral prodrome and a change in gait which suggests muscle weakness.  Rash is a later finding in JDM.  Radiographically, calcinosis of soft tissues is the hallmark although it occurs in only about 40% cases. Superfical plaque calcifications, deep tumoral calcifications and deposits in myofascial planes can be seen. Reticular skin calcifications are often quite extensive.\n\nIn contrast to the adult form of dermatomyositis, there is no increase in pulmonary disease and risk of malignancies with JDM.\n\nMRI is becoming the method of choice for surveying large muscle groups for evidence of inflammation.  Spectroscopy can demonstrate an abnormal ratio of muscle phosphocreatine to inorganic phosphates.\n\nThe most difficult differential diagnosis is with muscular dystrophy; which in contrast occurs predeominantly in males and is accompanied by the presence of dystrophy.",

            "Discussion": "Wilms\u2019 tumor is the most common renal tumor of childhood, with a peak incidence at 3-4 years of age. It is thought to be due to abnormal proliferation of the metanephric blastema, without normal differentiation into tubules and glomeruli. Wilms\u2019 tumors are histologically heterogeneous, comprised of three cell types in varying distributions: blastemal cells, stromal cells, and epithelial cells. While each of these components is variable in its level of differentiation, anaplasia (either focal or diffuse) is associated with an unfavorable prognosis. Nephroblastomatosis is characterized by the presence of multiple nephrogenic rests, which are foci of abnormally present renal blastemal cells. It is thought to be a precursor of Wilms\u2019, as the presence of intralobular nephrogenic rests has been associated with the development of WT.\n\nGrossly, WT is an intrarenal mass with both solid and cystic components. Although it distorts the anatomy of the collecting ducts, it rarely grows into the renal pelvis, ureter, or bladder. If invasion of the collecting system occurs, a patient may present with hematuria and/or obstruction. The tumor is usually surrounded by a pseudocapsule. It may contain areas of necrosis, which lead to hemorrhage and the appearance of cystic structures. True cysts may also be seen. Extension of the tumor mass into the corresponding renal vein is seen in about 40% of cases, and is associated with a higher incidence of surgical complications. Extension into the IVC is associated with a 40% rate of surgical complications. Large tumors that involve vital structures are associated with a higher rate of surgical complications, most notably tumor rupture which could then lead to recurrence. They are considered inoperable without preoperative chemotherapy.\n\nRadiologically, WT may be confused with congenital mesoblastic nephroma, in the first year of life. A mesoblastic nephroma is a solitary hamartoma which consists of immature renal stromal cells. It lacks blastemal cells and neoplastic metanephric elements, making it easy to differentiate from WT pathologically. However, it is a unilateral, single, solid mass arising from the kidney that may appear heterogeneous with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage on ultrasound and/or CT. Unlike WT, mesoblastic nephroma tends to infiltrate the renal parenchyma and does not form a pseudocapsule. It is more prominent in neonates, with a peak age at diagnosis of 3.5 months; however, isolated cases of mesoblastic nephroma in childhood and adulthood have been documented. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy increase the chances for overall morbidity, while excision alone results in cure.\n\nThe National Wilms\u2019 Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) recommends surgical staging of every case with the following breakdown:\nStage I: The tumor is isolated to the kidney and has been excised completely.\nStage II: The tumor had extended beyond the kidney but is excised completely. Capsular penetration, renal vein involvement, and renal sinus involvement may be found. Biopsy of the tumor results in some local spill.\nStage III: There is residual non-hematogenous tumor s/p resection, but it is confined to the abdomen. The resected specimen may have histologically positive margins, or part of the tumor has infiltrated the abdominal cavity. Lymph node findings are positive and/or peritoneal implants are found.    \nStage IV: Hematogenous or lymph node metastasis has occurred outside the abdomen or pelvis. \nStage V: There is bilateral renal involvement at the time of diagnosis. Each side is assigned a stage from I to III, and histology is based on biopsy findings. \nPostoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy are based on surgical staging and follow the guidelines of the NWTSG:\nStage I with favorable or unfavorable histology OR Stage II with favorable histology:\n- Nephrectomy\n- Postoperative chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin D (18 week course)\nStage II with focal anaplasia OR Stage III with favorable histology or focal anaplasia:\n- Nephrectomy\n- Abdominal irradiation (1080 cGy)\n- Chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin (24 week course)\nStage IV with favorable histology or focal anaplasia: \n- Nephrectomy\n- Abdominal irradiation according to local stage \n- Bilateral pulmonary irradiation and PCP prophylaxis \n- Chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin (24 week course)\nStage II through Stage IV with diffuse anaplasia:\n- Nephrectomy\n- Abdominal irradiation\n- Whole lung irradiation \n- Chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (24 week course)"

Nephroblastomatosis is characterized by the presence of multiple nephrogenic rests, which are foci of abnormally present renal blastemal cells. It is thought to be a precursor of Wilms\u2019, as the presence of intralobular nephrogenic rests has been associated with the development of WT.\n\nGrossly, WT is an intrarenal mass with both solid and cystic components. Although it distorts the anatomy of the collecting ducts, it rarely grows into the renal pelvis, ureter, or bladder. If invasion of the collecting system occurs, a patient may present with hematuria and/or obstruction. The tumor is usually surrounded by a pseudocapsule. It may contain areas of necrosis, which lead to hemorrhage and the appearance of cystic structures. True cysts may also be seen. Extension of the tumor mass into the corresponding renal vein is seen in about 40% of cases, and is associated with a higher incidence of surgical complications. Extension into the IVC is associated with a 40% rate of surgical complications. Large tumors that involve vital structures are associated with a higher rate of surgical complications, most notably tumor rupture which could then lead to recurrence. They are considered inoperable without preoperative chemotherapy.\n\nRadiologically, WT may be confused with congenital mesoblastic nephroma, in the first year of life. A mesoblastic nephroma is a solitary hamartoma which consists of immature renal stromal cells. It lacks blastemal cells and neoplastic metanephric elements, making it easy to differentiate from WT pathologically. However, it is a unilateral, single, solid mass arising from the kidney that may appear heterogeneous with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage on ultrasound and/or CT. Unlike WT, mesoblastic nephroma tends to infiltrate the renal parenchyma and does not form a pseudocapsule. It is more prominent in neonates, with a peak age at diagnosis of 3.5 months; however, isolated cases of mesoblastic nephroma in childhood and adulthood have been documented. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy increase the chances for overall morbidity, while excision alone results in cure.\n\nThe National Wilms\u2019 Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) recommends surgical staging of every case with the following breakdown:\nStage I: The tumor is isolated to the kidney and has been excised completely.\nStage II: The tumor had extended beyond the kidney but is excised completely. Capsular penetration, renal vein involvement, and renal sinus involvement may be found. Biopsy of the tumor results in some local spill.\nStage III: There is residual non-hematogenous tumor s/p resection, but it is confined to the abdomen. The resected specimen may have histologically positive margins, or part of the tumor has infiltrated the abdominal cavity. Lymph node findings are positive and/or peritoneal implants are found.    \nStage IV: Hematogenous or lymph node metastasis has occurred outside the abdomen or pelvis. \nStage V: There is bilateral renal involvement at the time of diagnosis. Each side is assigned a stage from I to III, and histology is based on biopsy findings. \nPostoperative chemotherapy and radiotherapy are based on surgical staging and follow the guidelines of the NWTSG:\nStage I with favorable or unfavorable histology OR Stage II with favorable histology:\n- Nephrectomy\n- Postoperative chemotherapy with vincristine and actinomycin D (18 week course)\nStage II with focal anaplasia OR Stage III with favorable histology or focal anaplasia:\n- Nephrectomy\n- Abdominal irradiation (1080 cGy)\n- Chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin (24 week course)\nStage IV with favorable histology or focal anaplasia: \n- Nephrectomy\n- Abdominal irradiation according to local stage \n- Bilateral pulmonary irradiation and PCP prophylaxis \n- Chemotherapy with vincristine, actinomycin D, and doxorubicin (24 week course)\nStage II through Stage IV with diffuse anaplasia:\n- Nephrectomy\n- Abdominal irradiation\n- Whole lung irradiation \n- Chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide (24 week course)\n\nTen percent of patients with Wilms\u2019 tumor have a recognizable phenotypic syndrome, such as WAGR syndrome, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, or Denys-Drash syndrome. Only 1% of Wilms\u2019 tumors are thought to be familial in origin.",

These diverticula protrude through a muscular gap in the anterolateral wall of the cervical esophagus below the cricopharyngeus muscle and lateral to the longitudinal muscle of the esophagus just below its insertion on the cricoid cartilage. This gap should be differentiated from the muscular gap in the posterior portion of the cricopharyngeus, the site of development of a Zenker's diverticulum. \n\nBoth Zenker's diverticulum and Killian-Jamieson diverticula occur at locations of anatomic weakness in the hypopharynx or cervical esophagus near the cricopharyngeus muscle. In contrast to the Killian-Jamieson diverticulum, a Zenker's diverticulum originates on the posterior wall of the pharyngoesophageal segment in a midline area of weakness just above the cricopharyngeus.  On pharyngoesophagography, it is seen lying posterior to the cervical esophagus on lateral images and in the midline on frontal images. In contrast, the Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is seen lying lateral to the cervical esophagus on frontal images and overlapping the anterior wall of the cervical esophagus on lateral images. \n\nThe diagnosis of either type of diverticulum is based primarily on the radiographic findings rather than on endoscopy. While endoscopy may identify the opening of a either type of diverticulum, its location in relation to the cricopharyngeus muscle is best seen when passage of the barium bolus outlines the protruding cricopharyngeus. The size of the sac and the relationship of the sac to the cervical esophagus are also best evaluated on barium studies. Therefore, the two forms of diverticula can be differentiated on the based upon the radiographic findings. \n\nStudies indicate that Killian-Jamieson diverticula are less common and considerably smaller than Zenker's diverticulum. They are also less likely to cause symptoms or be associated with gastroesophageal reflux than are Zenker's diverticula.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Lesions/Condition: Pulmonary Embolus\n\nDiscussion:  \n\nThe most important indication for Venitilation-Perfusion (V/Q) imaging is suspected pulmonary embolism (PE).  Numerous clinical conditions predispose to PE, including recent surgery (within 3 months), immobilization, thrombophlebitis, and underlying malignancy or other causes of a hypercoagulable state.   In women, pregnancy and use of estrogen are known risk factors.\n\nThe clinical presentation is often variable, and nonspecific, and dependent upon the size and number of emboli occluding the pulmonary circulation.  The classic presenting triad of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis is infrequently encountered.  The majority of patients presenting with PE demonstrate tachypnea, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough.  Patients may have a feeling of impending doom.  Tachycardia is commonly present.  Less commonly, patients may demonstrate wheezing, hypotension and syncope.\n\nThe D-dimer blood test is a screening tool for PE.  If a serum level less than 500 ng/L, further evaluation with imaging is unnecessary since the post-test probability of PE is 5% or lower.\n\nThe radiographic findings are often nonspecific and depend on whether the pulmonary emboli are associated with infarction. Abnormalities seen include an increase in the size of the central pulmonary arteries because of the presence of a large embolus.  Local oligemia may be present in the area distal to the PE.  Westermark\u2019s sign is when oligemia involves an entire lung secondary to a proximal clot.  A small pleural effusion may be evident. In severe cases acute cor pulmonale may be seen with cardiac enlargement and prominence of the superior vena cava and azygos vein.  Other findings include an elevated hemidiaphragm on the affected side, small pleural effusions, atelectasis with linear opacities, and occasionally Hamptom\u2019s hump, which is a pleura-based , wedge-shaped density may be evident.\n\nThe source of PE is most commonly from deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity.  Treatment most commonly consists of anticoagulation, which prevents clot propagation and allows endogenous fibrinolytic activity to dissolve existing thrombi.  Anticoagulation decreases mortality from 30-60% to less than 5%.  \n\nPrior to the advent of CT angiography, V/Q studies had been the mainstay for screening symptomatic patients for the presence of pulmonary embolism.  A normal perfusion scan excludes PE with a negative predictive value close to 100%.  A low-probability V/Q scan combined with a low-probability clinical assessment results showed PE in only 4% of patients.  A high-probability V/Q scan in a patient with high-probability clinical findings showed PE in 96% of patients.  With other combinations, PE was present in 16%-88% of patients requiring further evaluation.  \n\nThe V/Q scan is safe, widely available, and is an alternative chest imaging technique for patients who cannot undergo CT angiography.  One problem with scintigraphy is that many patients do not have a definitive result, (high or low probability)  and limited alternative diagnostic information is provided.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The differential for segmental lesions of the colon with narrowing include carcinoma, diverticulitis, Crohn's disease, ischemic colitis, or extrinsic narrowing from adjacent neoplastic or inflammatory process. (Reeder)  The focus here will be considerations in distinguishing diverticular disease versus carcinoma in the setting of large bowel obstruction.  Diverticular disease has sigmoid involvement in 99% of the cases in industrialized Western countries. (Farrell)  Colorectal adenocarcinoma is the most common malignancy of the GI tract and the second most common malignant tumor in the United States. (Beutow)  Approximately 50% arise in the rectum and rectosigmoid area.  Another 25% occur in the sigmoid colon, and the remaining 25% are evenly distributed throughout the remainder of the colon. (Beutow)  The determination of benign versus malignant stricture in the sigmoid colon is very important because of the differences in the treatment.  In addition,  the implications for staging of cancer and determination of appropriate therapy are issues that make identifying the correct diagnosis vital.  Further, large bowel obstruction secondary to sigmoid strictures is not uncommon.  In fact, the most common cause of large bowel obstruction is primary colon cancer estimated at 53% while diverticular disease is the cause in approximately 12% of the cases. (Greenllee)\n\tThe barium enema and computed tomography (CT) are two modalities used often to evaluate the cause of a sigmoid stricture.  There are general characteristics used to delineate benign versus malignant strictures with both. With the barium enema, a gradual zone of transition, preserved mucosal folds and presence of diverticula are considered benign features.  In contrast , an abrupt transition at the site of obstruction, destruction of mucosa and apple core configuration are considered malignant features. (Blakeborough)  It has been shown that in making  the diagnosis of diverticulitis with CT, the most specific findings are pericolonic stranding and length of the involved segment of more than 10 cm. The presence of pericolonic edema also favors diverticulitis. For colon cancer, the most specific findings are the presence of pericolonic lymph nodes and luminal mass. (Chintapalli)  In cases in which the patient presents with large bowel obstruction, both of these modalities may be helpful in evaluating the cause.  An added advantage of  barium enema is its benefit in aiding in the differentiation of mechanical versus pseudoobstruction.\n\tChapman et al reviewed 140 cases of LBO to determine the accuracy of water-soluble contrast enema in comparison with plain abdominal radiography. Findings at laparotomy and follow-up (for the nonoperative cases) were used as the reference. When reviewing the plain radiographs (being aware of the case history), the diagnosis of mechanical obstruction was made with a sensitivity and specificity of 84% and 72%, respectively, whereas contrast enema had a sensitivity and specificity of 96% and 98%, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.

Bicuspid aortic valve is frequently associated with coarctation of the aorta (reported incidence of 30 to 40 percent).\n\u2022               The stenotic area of the proximal aorta had an area of 0.17 cm^2 while the proximal descending aorta 1 cm below the stenosis had an area of 2.65 cm^2\n\u2022 \tCoarctation of the aorta is a common malformation accounting for six to eight percent of all congenital heart defects. \n\u2022 \tGirls with Turner syndrome are at increased risk with a prevalence rate of greater than 10 percent. \n\u2022 \tThe classical clinical manifestations are hypertension in the upper extremities, diminished and/or delayed femoral pulses, and low or unattainable arterial blood pressure in the lower extremities. \n\u2022 \tClinical presentation varies in different age groups. Neonates may be asymptomatic if there is a PDA or if the coarctation is not severe. Neonates with severe disease may present in heart failure and/or shock. Older infants and children may be asymptomatic or present (especially with exertion) with chest pain, cold extremities, and claudication. Adults will present with hypertension and if the coarctation is severe may have headaches, epistaxis, heart failure or aortic rupture or dissection.\n\u2022 \tChest radiographic findings vary with age and severity of the coarctation. In infants with heart failure, the chest radiograph usually shows generalized cardiomegaly with increased pulmonary vascular markings due to pulmonary venous congestion. In older children and adults, the heart size may remain normal but other findings include rib notching and the 3 sign (indentation of the aortic wall at the site of coarctation with pre and post-coarctation dilatation). \n\u2022 \tTwo-dimensional and Doppler transthoracic echocardiography is indicated for initial evaluation to establish the diagnosis and detect associated cardiac defects. \n\u2022 \tMR or CT angiography is indicated to define the location of the obstruction and identify collateral vessels. \n\u2022 \tEchocardiography or MRI are also useful for post-repair follow-up.

            "Title": "Coarctation of the Aorta",
            "Disease Discussion": "Coarctation of the Aorta (CoA), also known as congenital aortic stenosis, is a narrowing of the lumen of the aorta, which produces a flow obstruction. The anomaly accounts for 5-10% of all congenital heart defects and shows predominance in males of roughly 1.3 to 2.1 times that of females. When CoA becomes clinically relevant, it can lead to systemic hypertension and secondary left ventricular hypertrophy with heart failure. If it is not treated, the patient\u2019s mean age of death is about 34 years.\n\nCoA can present with other anomalies, most frequently of which is a bicuspid aortic valve, accompanying up to 60-85% of aortic coarctations. Although the true etiology of CoA is still unknown, this high correlation leads to the hypothesis that these two anomalies stem from a common congenital malformation. Due to the relatively high prevalence in males and in patients with Turner\u2019s syndrome, it has also been suggested that a link exists between the X-chromosome and the anomalous aorta and valve.\n\nCoarctation can occur in various locations along the length of the aorta. Stenosis prior to the emergence of the left subclavian artery is infrequent, with most coarctations occurring just distal to the left subclavian artery. Narrowing that occurs in the descending thoracic or abdominal aorta is exceedingly rare. Clinical presentation and symptoms are less related to anatomical position and more related to the degree of stenosis and the presence of associated abnormalities.\n\nCommon symptoms associated with CoA include epistaxis, arterial hypertension, headache, and leg fatigue. In younger male patients CoA should always be considered in differential diagnosis if upper extremity hypertension exists with lower extremity hypotension and weak pulses.\n\nIf a pressure gradient >30 mm Hg is present across the stenosis, surgical treatment should be considered. Various surgical interventions have been performed throughout the years, including resection of the stenotic tract with end-to-end anastamosis, subclavian flap aortoplasty, percutaneous balloon angioplasty, and more recently, expandable endovascular stents.",

            "Disease Discussion": "This case demonstrates hepatic metastases not visualized on a liver sulfur colloid scan but seen vividly on a sonogram.\n\nThree major noninvasive imaging modalities are used to evaluate hepatic metastases: CT, ultrasound, and scintigraphy.  CT has the best sensitivity and specificity if done both with and without intravenous contrast, with narrow window settings, and with 1-cm continuous sections.  The disadvantages include expense, radiation, time, intravenous contrast, and poor visualization of lesions near the diaphragmatic dome.\n\nUltrasound is comparable to CT in sensitivity and specificity.  It is usually less expensive, fast, has no radiation exposure, and allows excellent visualization of lesions near the diaphragms using longitudinal views.  Disadvantages include difficulty with obese patients and those with excessive bowel gas, and a strong technical dependence (e.g., using the proper focal length or frequency of transducer).  Both CT and ultrasound have the advantage of visualizing multiple organs in the search for a primary lesion.\n\nScintigraphy has the lowest specificity and sensitivity but is fast, relatively inexpensive, and has few technical dependencies.  Disadvantages are a low specificity, visualization limited to the liver and spleen, poor visualization of small or deep lesions, and limited usefulness in the face of underlying hepatocellular disease.\n\nEach modality has specific advantages that can be applied to particular situations.  For example, ultrasound is ideal for lesions in the left lobe or near the dome of the liver and at times can define small lesions not seen with other methods. Other lesions may be better seen with CT; however, this is usually not predictable in advance.  In general, scintigraphy is the least informative of the three techniques.\n\nLiver function tests are used as the initial screening for hepatic metastases.  They are nonspecific and also surprisingly insensitive for occult hepatic metastases.  With occult hepatic metastases, the tests for serum enzymes have the following sensitivities: alkaline phosphatase 6%, SGOT 38%, and LDH 81% (the most sensitive).  Once the hepatic metastases are palpable, all of these tests have sensitivities greater than 80%.",

            "Discussion": "This is a case of a 46 year-old black female with a history of sarcoidosis diagnosed at age 32 years, and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosed within the past year now presenting with mulitple myeloma.  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal B-cell malignancy consisting of terminally differentiated plasma cells.  In the United States, the incidence of disease is 3-4 newly diagnosed cases per 100,000 population per year, and represents 1% of all malignancies.  Demographically, patients are commonly African-American, with males slightly outnumbering females by 1.4-1.  Patients are typically elderly with a median age of 65 years at diagnosis, although cases in much younger patients have been reported.\n\nThe patient's presentation for MM is unusual given her relatively young age (46 years), lack of physical findings and history (i.e. fatigue, bone, recurrent infections), and laboratory abnormalities (i.e. hypercalcemia, elevated creatinine, elevated total protein) suggestive of  MM.  The bilateral lacrimal gland amyloidosis is a  unusual initial presentation for MM.  By comparison, lacrimal gland involvement in sarcoidosis is more common affecting 55-61% of patients at sometime during their disease course with similar findings on CT imaging.  Therefore, her management was based on the conclusion her presentation was a manifestation of her sarcoidosis and not MM.  The lack of response to therapy for the lacrimal gland enlargement ultimately prompted a biopsy of the gland six months from the time she sought medical attention, and one year since she reported initially having symptoms. \n\nThe lacrimal gland biopsy showed an inflamatory cell infiltrate, with nodules of pauci-cellular, eosinophillic staining material exhibiting apple-green birefringence on Congo Red staining.  This is consistent with amyloidosis of the lacrimal gland.  The lack of evidence of granulomatous disease present in the biopsy specimen strongly suggests that sarcoidosis is not the etiology of her lacrimal gland enlargement.  \n\nBased on the above findings, the patient received further laboratory and radiological investigations for the diagnosis of MM.   The diagnosis of MM is based on the demonstration of three components: 1) Serum or urine monoclonal protein identified by a characteristic monoclonal M protein spike on electrophoresis of urine and blood specimens; 2) >10% abnormal plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy; and 3) end-organ damage in the form of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, sequelae of amyloid deposition, and/or bone abnormalities on imaging.  Most patients will demonstrate symptomatic sequelae of of end-organ damage.  However, nearly 25% of patients with MM are discovered through incidental findings on laboratory studies and imaging. Indeed, radiographs provided the only significant finding suggestive of MM via a head CT that was obtained for the evaluation of URI symptoms of sinusitis in an emergency department several months prior to the lacrimal gland biopsy.  \n\nThe characteristic radiological feature of MM is the presence of a single osteolytic lucency (plasmacytoma), or, as in this patient's case, multiple discrete osteolytic lucencies (myelomatous) that are subcortical and found predominantly in the axial and proximal appendicular skeleton.  Lesions may also coalesce or take the form of diffuse osteopenia.  Sclerosing myeloma has also been described, although it is rare.  The osteolysis of MM is mediated by the secretion of chemokine factors by the malignant plasma cells that stimulate osteoclast proliferation, chemotaxis, maturation, and activity.  \n\nPlain film radiograph skeletal survey is the preferred diagnostic modality for the detection of bony involvement in MM.  Nearly 50% of the density of bone must be affected before the \"punched-out\" lesions are apparent, however, the presence of bone lesions is confirmed in 60-80% of all patients initially surveyed for MM with radiograph.  Other useful imaging studies include MRI, which may be used for the precise determination of lesion size and location for bone marrow biopsy, targeted radiotherapy, and for characterization of the extent of disease.  Imaging via CT is adjunctive to MRI for guided biopsy of lesions.  Recently, PET scanning has shown promise for monitoring disease recurrence by detection of lesions not readily seen on conventional radiograph.  \n\nDue to the osteolytic nature of MM, nuclear imaging via technec tium-99m (Tc-99m) bone scanning has no role in diagnosis or monitoring.  The sensitivity of Tc-99m scanning is dependent on osteoblastic activity, and therefore, underestimates the extent of disease.  Uptake of Tc-99m into radiographically abnormal regions is only 44% compared to conventional plain film.  This uptake is secondary to osteoblastic activity from pathological fracture, calcification within a plasmacytoma, or amyloidosis in association with tumor.  \n\nThe presence of osteolytic lesions is not pathognomonic of MM, as such findings may be present in a variety of conditions including other osteolytic metastases  and occasionally lymphoma) and hyperparathyroidism  Furthermore, bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement with homogenous soft tissue attenuation seen on CT is more suggestive of lacrimal gland sarcoidosis than other etiologies.  Neoplastic and infectious processes tend to present with discrete lesions within the lacrimal gland and/or are likely unilateral.  The chronicity of symptoms also would argue against a bilateral infection, as such a condition would be likely self-limiting.  The apparent overlap of expected findings in sarcoidosis versus that of MM likely contributed to the lag between initial presentation and diagnosis."

            "Title": "Unilateral Coronal Synostosis",
            "Disease Discussion": "Synostosis is the premature closure of one or more of the calvarial sutures which limits the ability of the skull to expand in a direction perpendicular to the suture. The sutures are dynamic: as the brain grows, the sutures expand, adding new bone.  An infant\u2019s brain grows rapidly, doubling in 6 months and again in 2 years.  If the sutures are compressed, either mechanically or due to failure of underlying CNS expansion, the sutures may either resorb or fuse.  Underlying brain growth causes increased growth parallel to the suture, resulting in characteristic head shapes.  Synostoses can be primary (fusion of single suture as an isolated event) or secondary, often associated with several syndromes. The prevalence of primary synostosis is about 1/4000 to 1/1000 live births. An inherited tendency or family history has been reported in many cases in the literature, however, most cases of isolated craniosynostosis are usually sporadic in occurrence with no known etiology.\n\nTrue craniosynostosis will not improve with time and usually worsens with growth.\n\nDiagnosis is made on the basis of characteristic head shape, presence of ridges overlying fused sutures, and rotation of facial landmarks. Radiologic studies are discussed below.\n\nClinically, signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) may also be present (vomiting, lethargy). Some synostoses are diagnosed in the context of syndromes (discussed below). \nA quick basic anatomy review is helpful before naming the synostoses. The bones of the calvarium are divided by sutures The metopic suture divides the frontal bones. The frontal bones are separated from the parietal bones by the coronal suture, and the two parietal bones are separated from each other by the sagittal suture. The occipital bone is separated from the parietal bones by the lambdoidal sutures. The space where the metopic, coronal and sagittal sutures come together is the anterior fontanel, and the posterior fontanel is present where the lambdoidal and sagittal sutures meet.\n\nCranial synostoses definitions are as follows:\nSagittal craniosynostosis results in scaphocephaly (keel/boat skull).\nMetopic craniosynostosis results in trigonocephaly (triangular skull).\nLambdoidal synostosis results in plagiocephaly (asymmetric skull).\nCoronal synostosis results in brachycephaly (short skull) if bilateral and frontal plagiocephaly if unilateral with ipsilateral eyebrow elevation giving the classic \u201charlequin eye\u201d appearance.\nBetween 10-20% of synostoses are associated with syndromes. Most of these syndromes are sporadic in occurrence. However, if one parent and one sib are affected, subsequent siblings have about 50% risk of having the syndrome. The most common is Crouzon syndrome involving the sagittal and coronal sutures with shallow orbits, proptosis, hypertelorism and sometimes hydrocephalus. \n\nApert Syndrome involve the coronal, sagittal and lambdoidal sutures with facial dysmorpism, syndactyly and cardiac defects.  Other rarer syndromes include Carpenter\u2019s, Pfeiffer\u2019s and Conrad\u2019s syndromes.\n\nRadiologic workup should center around CT. CT remains the most sensitive barometer of bony fusion. Plain films of the skull may appear normal.  Bone windows and thin slices are necessary with conventional axial CT slices. 3-D CT has simplified the diagnosis and has been show in studies to increase sensitivity. Three-dimensional CT scan processing by shaded-surface reconstruction, volumetric, and depth-coded methods have been shown to be superior to conventional plain radiographs and CT scans in diagnosing craniosynostosis.  The skull base and brain may show underlying abnormalities in the syndromic craniosynostoses. If the patient has increased intercranial pressure, calvarial table resorbtion has been seen with unknown clinical significance.\n\nMost patients with simple craniosynostosis have no neurological compromise, therefore corrective surgery is cosmetic. If the child is 18 months and the deformity is mild, it will not likely worsen and surgery can be avoided.  Conservative therapy involves positional therapy (head position while sleeping and controversial helmet therapy).\n\nSurgical correction is often done for psychosocial reasons with good results. Timing of surgical reconstruction is also controversial with some advocating early intervention (3-4 mos) and others recommend waiting until 8-10mos for better long-term results with less morbidity.  Most craniosynostoses today can be treated with a single surgery with excellent cosmetic results and minimal morbidity and nearly nonexistent mortality.",

The patient had fallen 2 weeks prior to this presentation and by her report had been placed on acetaminophen/oxycodone for pain in her right knee.  Shortly thereafter, the frequency of her stools decreased.  At presentation, the patient had not passed stool in 5 days.    Of note, the patient was admitted about one month prior for hyponatremia that was complicated by Clostridium difficile colitis.  The patient was still receiving oral vancomycin for treatment.  On arrival, she denied any abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, recent diarrhea, abdominal distension, dark or bloody stools, or bright red blood per rectum.    \n     Evaluation by the emergency physician noted a heart rate >150 beats per minute.  An electrocardiogram showed new onset atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response.  The patient was admitted to the cardiac care unit for further evaluation of the new dysrhythmia.  An acute abdominal series was obtained on admission for evaluation of constipation.\n     Over the first night of admission, the dysrhythmia spontaneously converted to sinus tachycardia.

These require that a patient present with any three of the following: fever >101.5\u00b0F (>38.6\u00b0C), heart rate >120 beats/min, white blood cell count >10.5, or anemia. Patients will likely also have evidence of dehydration, mental status changes, electrolyte disturbances, or hypotension.  \nThe diagnosis of colonic dilatation can be made by plain radiograph, but patients may also undergo computed tomography (CT).  Findings suggestive of toxic megacolon on plain film include dilatation of the transverse colon >6cm with or without small bowel distension.  A CT scan may reveal colonic wall thickening, pericolic stranding, or evidence of perforation or abscess formation.\nMedical management begins with fluid resuscitation, colonic decompression with nasointestinal tube and/or rectal tube, broad-spectrum antibiotics, and frequent repositioning to prevent air collections in one area of colon.  Abdominal radiographs should be repeated frequently.  Surgical intervention is often required.  Indications for total colectomy include perforation, and progressive toxicity or dilatation despite appropriate medical care."

            "Discussion": "In this particular case of a young child presenting with a cystic posterior fossa mass, imaging was helpful in narrowing the diagnosis. Evidence of bony remodeling and presence of a sinus tract indicated that this process was a chronic and possibly a congenital process. The midline location of this mass favors a dermoid rather than epidermoid which tends to occur more laterally. The presence of restricted diffusion on the DWI images suggested that this mass may represent an abscess or epidermoid. The presence of enhancement indicated infection which also fit the clinical picture.\n\nIn regards to cerebellar abscesses, treatment is dictated by the patient's clinical status, the size and location of the abscess and whether or not a capsule exists. Antibiotics with or without aspiration  or complete excision may be performed.\n\nOther diagnostic possibilities for a cystic posterior fossa mass include a cystic astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma, arachnoid cyst, and an epidermoid cyst. The presence of fat helps diferentiate dermoids from these other lesions. Intracranial lipomas are homogeneous fatty lesions and should not be confused with a heterogeneous lesion such as a dermoid."

When in the posterior fossa dermoids often have a sinus tract to the skin(dermal sinus) along with a defect of the overlying skull. The dermal sinus can allow the dermoid to become infected by providing direct access to overlying bacteria on the skin.\n\nPresenting symptoms can include headache, seizures, and cranial nerve deficits. The most common presentation is meningitis. There can be a painless lump under the scalp. Dermoid cysts are usually discovered during the first three decades of life with posterior fossa lesions often presenting in infancy and early childhood. Infection or rupture of a dermoid will lead to acute presentation of symptoms.\n\nThe CT appearance of a dermoid cyst is a unilocular, low attenuation, usually hetergeneous, well circumscribed mass. Hounsfeld Units below 0 help comfirm the presence of lipid. A heterogeneous nodule within the mass may represent matted hair. On MR a dermoid will be a hetergeneous mass with multiple regions of high T1 signal due to the liquified fat. If the dermoid has ruptured the high T1 signal will be scattered within the subarachnoid space. \n\nTreatment consists of surgical excision.",

            "Discussion": "The presentation of this patient along with her positive cultures solidifies the diagnosis of Cryptococcal pneumonia, a rare condition in an otherwise healthy female. Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus usually acquired via inhalation of dehydrated yeast cells or basidiospores that has been shown in analysis of soils to be found with pigeon excreta. Inhalation of the spores is believed to be the primary means of acquisition.  When considering the prevalence of the disease, serologic studies have demonstrated evidence of widespread subclinical infection in individuals without a history of symptomatic infection with most adults having a positive serum antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans. Thus, it appears that the subclinical primary infection is common and the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic.  Despite strong serologic evidence, symptomatic Cryptococcus remains a very rare disease in individuals without impaired immunity.  An active surveillance conducted in the early 90\u2019s in Alabama estimated the incidence of active Cryptococcus infections at 0.84 cases per 100,000 in non-HIV individuals.  However, in patients with advanced HIV infections living in San Francisco and Atlanta in the early 90\u2019s, the incidence was higher and was estimated to be anywhere from 17 to 66 cases per 1000 individuals.  Other patients who appear to be at increased risk include cancer patients and those individuals receiving organ transplants.  Thus, the subsequent course of the infection (resolution vs. latent infection vs. acute infection with or without dissemination) appears to be primarily determined by the host\u2019s immune status."

However, to the authors knowledge, it has not previously been associated with blast injuries. \nThe patient described in this report suffered a blast injury, rather than submersion near-drowning or a variation of cave in.  This different primary mechanism of injury necessitates consideration of pulmonary damage due to barotrama secondary to the blast itself.  Further, the patient exhibited multiple additional wounds, consistent with close exposure to an explosive device.  Blast lung, as the condition has been termed, is the second most common manifestation of primary organ damage in blast injuries and is due to the pressure differential across the alveolar-capillary interface.  Pulmonary injury can be sustained without evidence of external thoracic injury when the pressure wave carries sufficient force to compress the chest wall posteriorly against the spine.  The result is a transient elevation in intrathoracic pressure.  The classic imaging finding in pulmonary barotrauma, not present in this case, is described as a bihilar \u201cbutterfly\u201d pattern consistent with pulmonary contusion.  Additional findings may include pulmonary infiltrates, pneumothorax, and hemothorax among others."

            "Disease Discussion": "Lesions/Condition:  Sand Aspiration\n\nSynonyms: Gravel Aspiration, Silt Aspiration\n\nAssociations/Predisposing  Factors:  Blast injury, Drowning, Near Drowning\n\nThe presentation of sand aspiration is highly variable.  Certainly, sand visible within the oral cavity, oropharynx, or nasal passages can be indicative of sand aspiration in the correct clinical context.  Clinical presentation can range from rapid death due to total occlusion of the airway and subsequent anoxic death to a spectrum of dyspnea, cough, and variable obstructive symptoms.1-4  \nIn the past, the focus of reported radiographic imaging in sand aspiration has been on chest x-ray.  Findings on chest roentgenograms may be highly variable, however Bonilla-Santiago described a characteristic \u201csand bronchogram\u201d in two patients suffering from sand aspiration.2  Both of these patients exhibited particulate matter filling the bronchial tree as evidenced by radiodense material lining the central tracheobronchial tree in one case and linear radiodense opacities in the other.  In reported cases of particulate aspiration following accidental burial or cave-in, similar classic sand bronchograms have been reported.3,4  Other findings on x-ray are highly variable, ranging from near normal imaging to pulmonary edema characterized by fluffy, confluent, nodular perihilar opacities.2,4  The general pattern is that of opacification of the airway involved in aspiration.\nMore recent reports have included CT imaging of sand aspiration, though it is not routinely obtained and reports specifically detailing CT findings are limited in number.4  In a recent retrospective examination of post-mortem CT, as opposed to conventional autopsy in the diagnosis of drowning victims, sand and sediment in the bronchial tree were visualized on nearly half of the drowning victims.5  This finding raises the possibility that sand aspiration has been historically under-recognized in drowning and near-drowning incidents.  \t\nOn CT, it may be possible to appreciate sand bronchograms in the form of radiodense material filling the bronchial tree, similar to those previously described for plain chest films.  These findings may be more apparent in CT imaging when relatively subtle on chest x-ray.4 Additionally, aspirated material may be visible in the trachea as radiodensities, as it was in this case\u2019s presentation.   Findings of air fluid levels in the sinuses, while nonspecific and present in a wide variety of situations, can be suggestive of either drowning or aspirated material.5 Dunagan, et al reported findings of air-fluid-sand levels in the maxillary sinuses in one near drowning patient with sand aspiration.  CT is not routinely recommended in drowings, however, the true utility of CT in these instances has not been determined.3,4  In the setting of conclusive plain film radiographic findings, CT may not be necessary.  \nThere is increasing interest in the use of post-mortem CT in the evaluation of drowning patients which may in time be expanded to use in near-drowning and other causes of sand aspiration with equivocal chest x-ray findings. Post-mortem CT may be especially valuable in determining the course of events and progression of injury leading to death.",

            "Disease Discussion": "\u2022  Discussion: Cholangiocarcinomas  are rare slow-growing malignancies of the biliary duct system, that may occur anywhere within the biliary system from the liver to the ampulla of Vater. Cholangiocarcinomas are encountered in 3 geographic regions: intrahepatic, extrahepatic (ie, perihilar), and distal extrahepatic. Perihilar tumors are the most common and intrahepatic tumors are the least common. Perihilar tumors also called Klatskin tumors occur at the bifurcation of right and left hepatic ducts. 95% of these tumors are ductal adenocarcinomas and the remainder are squamous cell tumors. Local extension occurs into the liver, porta hepatis, and regional lymph nodes of the celiac and pancreaticoduodenal chains. The etiology of most bile duct cancers remains undetermined. Long-standing inflammation, as with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or chronic parasitic infection, has been suggested as playing a role by inducing hyperplasia, cellular proliferation, and, ultimately, malignant transformation. Cholangiocarcinomas is slow growing and tends to invade locally dissecting along tissue planes. In Southeast Asia, chronic infection with liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis has been causally related to cholangiocarcinomas. It also has an association with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.  Increased incidence has been noted in exposure to Thortrast radiopaque medium and in rubber industries. Several congenital diseases also show a relationship, including choledochal cysts and Caroli\u2019s disease. \n\n\u2022  Clinical presentation:\nPatients often present with painless jaundice and many patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease.  Pruritis and non-specific abdominal pain are other common complaints. Physical exam findings include hepatomegaly (tender/non-tender), a palpable non-tender gallbladder (Courvoisier sign) and splenomegaly secondary to portal hypertension. Lab findings include elevated LFT\u2019s.  CEA and CA 19-9 tumor markers may be positive but cholangiocarcinomas does not produce alpha feto proteins (AFP).\n\n\u2022 Imaging:\nInitial evaluation should be with ultrasound and CT.  The most common US finding is general ductal dilitation.  Focal ductal dilitation, lobar atrophy, bile duct wall thickening and rarely a polypoid mass within the ducts may also be seen.  CT demonstrates biliary dilation as well but can show thickening of the bile duct walls more accurately. In peripheral cholangiocarcinomas the CT scan is often nonspecific demonstrating minimal contrast enhancement with a poorly defined isoattenuating or hypoattenuating mass.  Delayed enhancement (8-10 min) is useful in hilar tumors.  The tumor itself is only identified in about 50% of cases.  CT is good at showing lymphadenopathy and lobar atrophy.  Cholangiography(ERCP or PTC) is very helpful in demonstrating ductal anatomy and has the added benefit of enabling stent placement for drainage. MRI Cholangiography is being used more frequently and may help define tumor extension into portal vessels.\n\n\u2022  Treatment:\nStenting is very useful in both palliative care to relieve obstruction and for symptomatic relief preop.  The only possible cure is complete resection but imaging confirmation of complete resection is often impossible. Lesions are considered unresectable if tumor involves either both lobes of the liver or major portal veins or hepatic arteries. Overall resecatability is about 40%. Chemo and radiation therapy can be used for palliative treatment but show little benefit. Celiac-plexus block via regional injection of alcohol or other sclerosing agent can relieve pain in the mid-back associated with retroperitoneal tumor growth.",

            "Title": "Pancreatic Carcinoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Pancreatic cancer is the 10th most common cancer in the United States and the 4th most common cause of cancer death. It is an aggressive and usually fatal tumor. Most pancreatic cancers occur in the pancreatic head (60%)and less commonly in the body (15%) or tail (5%).  20% diffusely involve the entire gland. The overall 5 year survival rate is less than 5%. The only realistic hope for cure is in early detection and aggressive surgery (Whipple procedure). Imaging modalities utilized in the detection and evaluation of pancreatic carcinoma include ultrasound, MRI, and CT.\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of transabdominal ultrasound for the detection of pancreatic carcinoma approaches 90% in advanced cases, with much lower sensitivity and specificity in early stage disease. Small carcinomas (2 to 3cm) are solid, hypoechoic, and ill-defined.  Larger tumors are more heterogeneous with well defined, lobulated, or irregular margins.  Ultrasound may also detect calcifications, ductal dilatation and fluid collections. Pancreatic carcinoma may be surrounded by chronic pancreatitis and ultrasound is not very useful in differentiating the two.\n\nContrast enhanced CT is the most frequently performed study for the evaluation of pancreatic carcinoma.  Characteristic findings include a minimally enhancing, hypodense mass that commonly produces the \"double-duct\" sign - a dilated common bile duct and pancreatic duct. The uncinate process often appears blunted.  There may be stranding in the peripancreatic mesentery signaling peri-pancreatic invasion. Vascular encasement of the nearby superior mesenteric vessels, portal vein, hepatic artery, or celiac trunk renders the tumor inoperable. \n\nMRI can be used to correlate CT findings and for surgical staging. MRI has a similar sensitivity to CT for detecting peri-pancreatic and vascular invasion.  On non-contrast MR imaging, pancreatic carcinomas are typically hypointense on T1 weighted images and hyperintense on T2 weighted images, With gadolium MRI, the most prominent enhancement of the lesion occurs 15 seconds after injection.",

            "Title": "Nontraumatic Subarachnoid Hemorrhage",
            "Disease Discussion": "The classic presentation of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is the acute onset of a severe headache which reaches its maximum intensity within minutes, often referred to as the \u201cthunder clap\u201d headache. Many patients describe this as \"the worst headache of my life\".  There may be associated neck stiffness, photophobia, nausea, vomiting, and possibly obtundation or coma.\n\nPhysical examination may show retinal hemorrhages, nuchal rigidity, or focal neurological signs. An altered level of consciousness is seen in approximately one third of patients while meningeal irritation signs are seen in up to 85% of patients and virtually all have nausea.   Kernig sign is pain elicited by straightening the knee with the thigh flexed at the hip.  Brudzinski sign is pain and/or ridgidity with simultaneous neck and knee/hip flexion.   \n\nThe differential diagnosis of a thunder clap headache includes aneurysm thrombosis without rupture, \u201cleakage\u201d into an aneurysm wall, aneurysm rupture with subarachnoid hemorrhage, cerebral vein/dural venous sinus thrombosis, localized meningeal inflammation, nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage, first or worst migraine headache attack, benign exertional headache, and benign thunderclap headache [no associated subarachnoid hemorrhage]. Since early recognition and surgery may benefit patients with aneurysm rupture, all patients with thunderclap headache require evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage. In North America, 75% to 90% of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is caused by aneurysm rupture.  \n\nThe primary diagnostic modalities in the evaluation of subarachnoid hemorrhage include noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan and, if negative, a lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spectrophotometry. The probability of detecting subarachnoid hemorrhage of CT scans performed at various intervals after the ictus is: day 0, 95%; day 3, 74%; day 7, 50%; day 14, 30%; and day 21, almost zero.  It is important to note that the sensitivity of CT in detecting subarachnoid hemorrhage decreases with time, and may miss up to 5% of cases even in the first 12 hours after symptom onset.\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging is not as sensitive in the detection of acute subarachnoid hemorrhage and does not usually play a role in the initial diagnostic evaluation.  MR findings include alteration of CSF (reduced diffusion and bright CSF on DWI, bright on FLAIR). CT has greater availability, lower expense, and faster scanning times. \n\nAcute subarachnoid hemorrhage appears as high attenuation on noncontrast CT within the subarachnoid spaces.  Blood will insinuate within the sulci over the cerebral convexities as it mixes with CSF. A focal cisternal or parenchymal hemorrhage may suggest the location of a ruptured aneurysm - although this localization is often postural. Focal anterior interhemispheric blood may be due to an anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture. Blood in the sylvian fissure may be due to a middle cerebral artery, internal carotid artery terminus, or posterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture. Posterior communicating artery aneurysms may be associated with third cranial nerve palsies and often bleed into the temporal lobe. Posterior inferior cerebellar artery aneurysms often bleed into the fourth ventricle.\n\nNonthrombosed aneurysms may be seen as a well delineated, isodense to slightly hyperdense mass located somewhat eccentrically in the suprasellar cistern or sylvian fissure. \n\nAfter detection of subarachnoid hemorrhage by either CT or lumbar puncture the evaluation can proceed directly to a four vessel catheter angiogram.  At some institutions, however, a CT angiogram (CTA) of the head is the preferred next step.   Several studies have shown that CTA is excellent at detecting aneurysms larger than 3 mm. When a CTA adequately demonstrates an aneurysm, patients can proceed to definitive treatment without a catheter angiogram.  In some institutions, catheter angiograms are preferred to CTA, and are always the next step for patients in whom no aneurysm is detected on CTA or in patients with aneurysms amenable to endovascular intervention by coils or balloon occlusion.\n\nApproximately 90% of all intracranial aneurysms arise from the anterior (carotid) cerebral circulation while 10% arise from the posterior (vertebrobasilar) circulation. The most common locations are the anterior communicating artery (35%), posterior communicating artery origin (30%), middle cerebral artery bifurcation or trifurcation (25%), basilar artery tip (5%), and the posterior inferior cerebellar artery and other sites distal to the circle of Willis (5%). Up to 30% of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage have multiple intracranial aneurysms, that may present in \"mirror image\" locations. Patent aneurysms are seen as a contrast filled outpouching from the vessel wall on angiography. Ruptured aneurysms typically have an irregular or lobulated appearance.  Localized vasospasm and subarachnoid hemorrhage are also helpful signs of aneurysm rupture, particularly in those patients with multiple aneurysms.\n\nRisk factors for development of intracranial aneurysms include numerous connective tissue disorders and account for approximately 5% of cases.  Associated conditions include:  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, hypertension, aortic coarctation, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, and fibromuscular dysplasia. Other etiologies include drug abuse (cocaine), infection (mycotic aneurysms), neoplasm, or trauma. \n\nIn approximately 15-30% of patients with nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage, no aneurysm is found despite a complete four vessel cerebral angiogram. These patients fall into two distinct subsets: a nonaneurysmal perimesencephalic hemorrhage pattern and an \u201caneurysmal\u201d pattern. In the first (perimesencephalic) subset, the hemorrhage is typically anterior to the brainstem and within the interpeduncular fossa or ambient cisterns and is thought to result from rupture of small pontine or perimesencephalic veins.\n\nIn the second subset of patients, subarachnoid hemorrhage fills the suprasellar cistern and extends into the sylvian or anterior interhemispheric fissures. Patients with an aneurysmal pattern of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage are at risk for rebleeding, cerebral ischemia, and neurological deficit Repeat four-vessel cerebral angiography demonstrates an aneurysm in 5% to 10% of these cases. Non-identification of the aneurysm on the first angiogram may be secondary to local vasospasm with incomplete filling of the aneurysm. \n\nAcute subarachnoid hemorrhage carries a mortality rate of 25% in the first 24 hours and 50% within three months. Causes of sudden death include a large intraparenchymal hematoma, destruction of brain tissue, acute hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, myocardial ischemia, cardiac arrhythmias, and respiratory failure. Of the patients that reach a major medical center the leading causes of death are the sequelae of the initial hemorrhage, recurrent aneurysmal rupture and vasospasm with ischemic stroke. While the potential complications of subarachnoid hemorrhage are extensive, the primary goal of medical management is to address the leading causes of death by trying to prevent vasospasm and recurrent hemorrhage. \n\nVasospasm typically occurs seven days (5-10 days) after the subarachnoid hemorrhage, and is prevented predominantly via administration of a calcium channel blocker such as nimodipine, which decreases blood pressure but increases cerebral blood flow. Maintaining adequate hydration is also important. Transcranial Doppler evaluation is helpful in monitoring for the development of vasospasm by detecting elevated intracranial arterial velocities. This is seen most frequently in the distal internal carotid artery and the proximal portions of the anterior and middle cerebral arteries, regardless of the location of the aneurysm rupture.  Once vasospasm occurs, medical therapy is aimed at increasing cerebral blood flow, predominantly with volume expansion and drug-induced hypertension. Transluminal angioplasty is extremely successful in dilating vasospastic arteries.\n\nThe prevention of recurrent hemorrhage, which is highest immediately after the initial subarachnoid hemorrhage, is through early surgical or endovascular treatment of the ruptured aneurysm. Endovascular therapy with platinum coils was introduced in 1990 as an alternative to surgical clipping. The International Subarachnoid Aneurysm Trial (ISAT) demonstrated a significant risk reduction with endovascular therapy over surgery for ruptured aneurysms amenable to either therapy. Endovascular treatment is particularly useful in posterior circulation aneurysms, such as a basilar tip aneurysm, in which the surgical approach is extremely difficult.  With the exception of difficult access to posterior circulation aneurysms, surgical clipping is an effective and definitive treatment modality of ruptured aneurysms. Patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage should be evaluated in treatment centers that offer both neurosurgery and neuroendovascular treatment, allowing the neurosurgeons and interventional neuroradiologists to assess the advantages and disadvantages of clipping or coiling for each individual patient.\n\nIn summary, nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is the most common secondary cause of the worst headache of life and 75% to 90% of nontraumatic subarachnoid hemorrhage is caused by aneurysm rupture. Since early diagnosis and treatment of aneurysm rupture may improve the patient\u2019s outcome, all patients presenting with the worst headache of life require evaluation for subarachnoid hemorrhage with a noncontrast CT scan and a lumbar puncture if the CT scan is negative. Once subarachnoid hemorrhage is detected, either a CT angiogram or a catheter angiogram should be performed, preferably at a facility with both interventional neuroradiologists and neurosurgeons. This allows the patient to undergo aneurysm coiling or clipping and be appropriately managed for common complications such as vasospasm or recurrent hemorrhage.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Discussion: \nThe right paratracheal stripe is usually 2mm wide, but may be up to 5mm wide.  An enlarged paratracheal stripe (>5mm) is an important marker for otherwise subtle adenopathy, as well as tracheal tumor, mediastinal inflammation or hemorrhage, pleural thickening or pleural effusion.  The margins of the paratracheal stripe are: \n1. distal end\u2014formed by the azygous vein\n2. medial margin\u2014the air-soft tissue interface along the right mucosal surface of the trachea\n3. outer margin\u2014begins around the medial end of the clavicle and is formed by the RUL plural surface\nThe stripe ends where the RUL bronchus goes under the azygous vein as it arches anteriorly to empty into the SVC.\nThe malignant lymphomas are divided into Hodgkin\u2019s and non-Hodgkin\u2019s groups.  Sir Thomas Hodgkin was the first to describe Hodgkin\u2019s disease in 1932.  Hodgkin\u2019s can present at any age, but it is more prevalent among adolescents and young adults.  It typically presents as painless, rubbery lymphadenopathy involving the superficial lymph node groups.  Cervical nodes are involved nearly 70% of the time.  Approximately half of patients also have splenomegaly.  Mediastinal involvement occurs in approximately 10% of patients, and mediastinal involvement is characteristic of the Nodular Sclerosing type (as in this patient).  Cutaneous involvement can occur and is usually a late complication.  Patients may also present with constitutional symptoms (night sweats, pruritis, fatigue, weight loss, etc) with widespread disease.  \nThe diagnosis of Hodgkin\u2019s disease is made by lymph node biopsy (as was done in this patient).  There are 4 histological types:\n1.\tNodular Sclerosing (>50%, most common; worst prognosis)\n2.\tMixed cellularity (25%)\n3.\tLymphocyte predominant (5%; best prognosis)\n4.\tLymphocyte depleted (5%)\nStaging of Hodgkin\u2019s disease is made by the use of CXR, BM biopsy, and CT imaging.  There are 4 stages:\n1.\tStage I\u2014confined to one lymph node group (90% 5-yr survival rate)\n2.\tStage II\u2014confined to 2 or more lymph node groups on one side of the diaphragm\n3.\tStage III\u2014involving nodes on both sides of the diaphragm\n4.\tStage IV\u2014Extra-nodal disease (60% 5-yr survival rate) \nTreatment involves radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy.  Patients with Stage I or Stage II Hodgkin\u2019s disease are usually treated by radiation therapy, while Stage III & IV disease is usually treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\nReferences:\n1.

Most of these cases are due to advanced gastric carcinoma and less commonly related to metastatic cancer or invasion of adjacent malignancies such as bile duct cancer or gallbladder cancer.  Malignant obstruction causes luminal narrowing due to an annular constricting lesion or diffuse mural infiltration by tumor.  Approximately one-third of patient with malignancy have no pain, and most others have a history of pain of less than 1 year\u2019s duration.  \n\nThe most common cause of gastric outlet obstruction in adults is peptic ulcer disease (60% to 65% of cases).  The obstructing lesion is usually in the duodenum, occasionally in the pyloric channel or prepyloric gastric antrum, and rarely in the body of the stomach.  Obstruction is from severe luminal narrowing resulting from spasm, acute inflammation and edema, muscular hypertrophy, or contraction of scar tissue.  Distortion and scarring of the duodenal bulb make peptic ulcer disease the most likely cause of obstruction, while a radiographically normal bulb increases the likelihood of underlying malignant disease.  These patients often have a long history of ulcer pain.  \n\nInflammatory disorders which cause gastric outlet obstruction include Crohn\u2019s disease, sarcoidosis, syphyllis, tuberculosis, amyloidosis, corrosive stricture, pancreatitis, and cholecystitis. Congenital disorders such as antral mucosal diaphragm (antral web), gastric duplication and rarely annular pancreas can cause outlet obstruction.

Several risk factors are associated with sacral insufficiency fractures, the most common being osteoporosis. However, rheumatoid arthritis, corticosteroid therapy, osteomalacia, Paget\u2019s disease, osteogenesis, osteopetrosis, and fibrous dysplasia are also potential risk factors (1).     Patients with sacral insufficiency fractures typically present with low back pain, buttock pain, groin pain, or hip pain.  The most common site of sacral fractures is the sacral ala. The fractures typically course vertically parallel to the sacroiliac joints.  Sacral insufficiency fractures are often times difficult to diagnose for several reasons.  Findings on plainradiographs are subtle and may be overlooked due to obscuration of bony detail by bowel gas.  Stress fractures are difficult to detect through cancellous bone in patients with osteoporosis.  Another reason that this diagnosis is overlooked if the interpreter is not familiary with insufficiency fractures in the sacrum (2).  The main radiographic evidence of such a fracture is sclerosis secondary to trabecular compression and callus formation.    Additional studies may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.  Computed tomography can accurately confirm diagnosis by demonstrating unilateral or bilateral fracture lines in the sacral ala parallel to the sacroiliac joints.  With healing, the fracture lines become sclerotic.  Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates fracture lines as decreased areas of signal intensity on T1 weighted images.  Bone scintigraphy commonly produces an H-pattern or butterfly pattern of increased signal uptake consistent with bilateral sacral fractures with vertical and horizontal fracture components (3)."

Another reason that this diagnosis is overlooked if the interpreter is not familiary with insufficiency fractures in the sacrum (2).  The main radiographic evidence of such a fracture is sclerosis secondary to trabecular compression and callus formation.    Additional studies may be performed to confirm the diagnosis.  Computed tomography can accurately confirm diagnosis by demonstrating unilateral or bilateral fracture lines in the sacral ala parallel to the sacroiliac joints.  With healing, the fracture lines become sclerotic.  Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrates fracture lines as decreased areas of signal intensity on T1 weighted images.  Bone scintigraphy commonly produces an H-pattern or butterfly pattern of increased signal uptake consistent with bilateral sacral fractures with vertical and horizontal fracture components (3).",

Symptoms can include but are not limited to infrequent or difficulty having a bowel movement, distended abdomen, pain, and vomiting. \n\nIn most cases, extensive testing does not need to be performed. If constipation last for more than two weeks, blood tests can be obtained to detect hormonal imbalances or barium studies, colonoscopy or CT to detect obstruction. \n\nConstipation can be treated with a laxative, stool softener, and/or a well balanced diet, exercise, and drinking plenty of water.",

There is usually less edema and mass effect present as compared to a GBM. They tend to be hyperintense to grey matter on DWI and hypointense on ADC map, as was the case with this patient. A GBM is generally hyperintense on both DWI and ADC, which was not the case here. Pathology confirmed that this lesion was a GBM and not a CNS lymphoma."

            "Disease Discussion": "Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) is also known as Lynch syndrome, of which, there are two types.  Lynch I has no history of associated cancers.  Lynch II often presents with other cancers most commonly of ovarian or uterine origin. Both types are predisposed to a higher frequency of proximal colonic tumors with advanced pathology compared to typical colon cancer. \n\nHNPCC typically presents during the fourth and fifth decades and characterized by adenomas that progress much more rapidly to carcinoma than typical.  These are not as numerous as those in Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).  It also has a more heterogenous genetic basis than FAP, with most cases linked to chromosomes 2,3, and 7.  As such, the diagnosis is often based upon familial history of early colorectal cancer presentations (prior to 50 years of age).\n\nGenetic testing is often difficult secondary to multiple site mutations and is positive in approximately 80% of affected individuals.  However, agressive surveillance of all first degree relatives of individuals clinically suspected to have the syndrome is warranted.\n\nScreening should begin at age 20 to 25 consist of colonoscopy every other year.  Alternatively, genetically positive individuals should be considered for prophylactic colectomy.  Affected females should consider early childbearing followed by prophylactic total abdominal hyterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy.\n\nImaging characteristics are those of the respective cancers.  In the case of colon cancer, it often presents as an intraluminal filling defect with bowel wall thickening and adjacent inflammation (fat stranding).  It is often focal and is frequently accompanied by adjacent lymphadenopathy.  It can be difficult to differentiate this entity from diverticulitis which can also present with similar findings.  However, the wall thickening and pericolonic inflammation are more likely to be focal in colon cancer, whereas it more likely to involve larger segments in diverticulitis (greater than 10 CM).  Also, diverticulitis is much less likely to have associated lymphadenopathy and intaluminal mass.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Pulmonary sequestration is a congenital anomaly of the bronchopulmonary foregut in which there is a nonfunctional segment of lung. The blood supply is anomalous, arising from the systemic circulation (ie. the aorta or bronchial arteries ). By definition, there is no typical communication with the bronchial tree or with the pulmonary arteries. Intralobar and extralobar discrimination is based primarily upon venous drainage, and the presence of an independent pleural lining (as in the extralobar type). The intralobar variant drains to the pulmonary veins or left atrium, the extralobar type to the systemic venous system (the inferior vena cava or the azygous system). Both gain blood supply from the systemic arterial circulation, frequently from below the diaphragm, and identification of this confirms the diagnosis (although failure to identify the arterial supply does not exclude it).  \n\nIn comparison, intralobar sequestrations usually become manifest during adolescence or adulthood, whereas extralobar sequestrations present at birth or soon thereafter (or may be suspected based upon prenatal ultrasonography). Intralobar sequestrations are three times more common with a male predominance, and a much lower incidence of associated anomalies (10% with associated skeletal, foregut, or diaphragmatic anomalies).  Extralobar sequestrations may have associated anomalies in up to 65% of patients, including diaphragmatic defects, pulmonary hypoplasia, bronchogenic cysts, and cardiac anomalies.  Intralobar sequestrations present with recurrent pneumonias, chronic cough, or dyspnea, or may be completely asymptomatic. Other complications of intralobar sequestrations include hemoptysis, and intrathoracic hemorrhage, and where there is marked vascular shunting, cardiac decompensation.  Extralobar sequestrations, presenting at birth or infancy, may manifest as cyanosis, respiratory distress, feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and recurrent pneumonias. Both predominantly are located in the left base in 60-90%.  Treatment of both is resection.\n\n==========================================\nAnimation showing origin of pulmonary vessel from descending thoracic aorta:\nhttp://rad.usuhs.mil/medpix/multimedia_files/mv002.mpg",

            "Disease Discussion": "Pulmonary artery dilation is most commonly an acquired sequela of chronic pulmonary hypertension, although rarely idiopathic dilation of the pulmonary trunk does occur, a diagnosis that can only be conferred after exclusion of underlying cardiac pathology and confirmatory measurements of normal right ventricular and pulmonary artery pressures. \n\nChronic pulmonary hypertension (resting mean pulmonary artery pressure > 25mm Hg or >30mm Hg with exercise) is most commonly the result of hypoxic lung disease such as obstructive lung disease or fibrosis. Less commonly,  pulmonary hypertension may occur secondarily as the result of scleroderma, CREST syndrome, chronic pulmonary embolism or thrombotic disease, chronic left-to-right shunting, intravascular pulmonary metastases, or chronic parasitic infection. \n\nLess commonly, pulmonary artery dilation can be seen in the context of a congenitally stenotic pulmonary valve. The stenotic valve creates a high pressure jet of blood that results in post stenotic dilation of the main and left pulmonary artery. The right pulmonary artery is spared thanks to a sharp, 90 degree take-off from the main pulmonary artery that allows it to avoid the high pressure flow. \n\nAlternatively, a pulmonary artery aneurysm may be initially interpreted as concentric pulmonary artery dilation. Causes of pulmonary artery aneurysms included mycotic aneurysm, Marfan syndrome, Behcet's disease, or may be iatrogenic following an intravascular procedure.  \n\nOn PA or AP chest xray, pulmonary artery dilation will appear as a left mediastinal bulge, and may be confused for a mediastinal mass between the aortic arch and border of the left ventricle. \n\nOn chest CT, the diameter of a dilated pulmonary artery may be directly measured as being greater than 29mm, a finding that is 87% sensitive and and 89% specific for pulmonary hypertension. Additional CT findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension include a ratio of pulmonary artery diameter to aorta diameter greater than 1:1, as well as decreased caliber of peripheral pulmonary vessels due to vasoconstriction, mosaic lung attenuation, and right ventricular dilation.\n\nIn the setting of pulmonary valve stenosis, the main and left pulmonary arteries are dilated, the right pulmonary artery retains normal diameter, and the right ventricle may be dilated due increased resistance across the stenotic valve. \n\nManagement and follow up for dilated pulmonary artery is dictated by the underlying etiology.",

            "Title": "Mucus Plug",
            "Disease Discussion": "Mucus plugs have numerous causes which include dysfunctional cilia, transport defects seen at the cellular level, pathology that causes airflow obstruction/edema/inflammation, and hypersecretion of the goblet cells.  Some disease processes known to cause these problems include cystic fibrosis, pneumonia, COPD, bronchiectasis, bronchitis, asthma, Kartagener\u2019s syndrome, tuberculosis, aspergillous ect.  \n     \nThe exact mechanism of mucus plugging is not known.  Mucus accumulation is governed by the rate of mucus secretion and clearance through epithelial reabsorption, evaporation, cough transport, and ciliary transport. A defect in any one of these systems can disrupt the balance and cause pathology.  It is postulated in infammatory processes that the inflammation and edema impair the mucociliary transport system, and epithelial reabsorption causing an inability to effectively clear the mucus that is produced.  Accummulation of mucus in lungs with mucosal edema and bronchoconstriction give optimal conditions for airway plugging.    \n     \nOther causes of increased mucosal production are decreased cilia motility include inhaled pollutants.  The most notorious of these is cigarette smoke which is also one of the major risk factors for developing COPD.  Under optimal conditions, mucus can be propelled by cilia at speeds up to 10mm/min with cilia beating at 20Hz.  Normal functioning cilia can clear 50% of particulate matter introduced into the lung in approximately 30 minutes.  However, this lung function can be dramatically reduced in acute and chronic lung processes leading to pulmonary dysfunction.\n     \nThere are a variety of methods to control the accumulation of mucus in the pulmonary system.  Proposed methods include inhibiting hypersecretion, stimulating ciliary clearance, and stimulating cough clearance. It was believed that mucolytic agents such as N-acetylcysteine help decrease the viscosity and elasticity of the mucus allowing for easier clearance. However, studies involving this medication have not shown a significant effect in the clearance of mucus.  Chest physical therapy which moves mucus by gravity, vibration has been demonstrated to increase mucus clearance and is a commonly emplyed therapy. Bronchodilators are also often used to help open the airways.  However, the best method for decreasing pathologic mucus in the pulmonary system is to treat and control the underlying disorder.",

Until thoracocentesis or pleural biopsy is performed, mesothelioma or metastatic disease cannot be distinguished.\n\nCT is more advantageous over chest radiography in evaluating nodular pleural thickening.  All pleural surfaces are evaluated for enhancing tumor implants, in addition to the presence of pleural effusions.  Circumferential pleural thickening, including involvement of the mediastinal pleura is more often due to malignancy than benign pleural disease.

Unilateral nonperfusion with a normally perfused contralateral lung is even less common. While pulmonary thromboembolism is the most common cause of a perfusion defect on perfusion imaging, it is a relatively uncommon cause of unilateral hypoperfusion (especially if the perfused lung shows little or no abnormalities).  Because pulmonary emboli are usually multiple, a single large unilateral defect suggests other diagnoses. The differential diagnosis for the most common causes of unilateral nonperfusion with a normally perfused contralateral lung includes bronchogenic carcinoma (the most common cause), congenital heart disease, hyperlucent lung syndrome / Swyer-James syndrome, post surgical changes, and fibrosing mediastinitis. \n\nHistoplasmosis is the most common cause of fibrosing mediastinitis in the United States, several times more common than tuberculosis, the second leading cause. Fibrosing mediastinitis results from excessive scarring around the hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes, presumably resulting from reaction to antigens released from Histoplasma organisms. Typically this presents several years after the initial infection. Fibrosing mediastinitis represents a noninfectious complication of histoplasmosis rather than an active and progressive infection. The presence of calcification indicates that the initial infection occurred several years earlier. Also, failure to isolate Histoplasma capsulatum from surgical specimens supports the assumption that the infection is no longer active.",

While most incidents are idiopathic, about half of all patients presenting with optic neuritis will go on to develop multiple sclerosis with young adults having the greatest risk.  Of all cases of MS, optic neuritis is the initial presenting symptom in 15-20%. Other less common diseases associated with optic neuritis include ischemia, sarcoid, systemic lupus erythematosus, syphilis, viral infection, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and radiation therapy. MR is the best imaging modality for optic neuritis with thin slice axial and coronal images are preferred. T2-weighted images and short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) sequences show high signal intensity in the abnormal nerve with the nerve being frequently enlarged. Gadolinium is particularly useful, especially with fat saturation, with focal enhancement of the retrobulbar optic nerve sometimes being seen. Perivenous inflammation is responsible for the enhancement and can be seen in approximately 50% of patients with acute optic neuritis. Overall, MR sensitivity for optic neuritis is low, with much of the utility derived from its ability to exclude other causes of optic nerve compromise such as an orbital tumor.",

            "Discussion": "Patient presented with a 2 month history of increasing inspiratory and expiratory stridor which began after 2 separate sinus surgeries within the past two months for chronic erosive sinusitis. During the first surgery, the patient was intubated with a cuffed 6.5mm endotracheal tube. During the second surgery, the anesthesiologist could only pass a 5mm uncuffed tube.After the surgeries she developed worsening inspiratory and expiratory stridor. \n\nPertinent past history is that the patient experienced her first episode of epistaxis several years prior to surgery and had multiple subsequent clinical visits for sinusitis.  She was diagnosed with erosive chronic sinusitis, for which the surgeries were performed. She also has a remote history of migratory arthralgias/joint effusions/fevers and ulcerative colitis (diagnosed by colonscopy). \n\nIn regards to her acute presentation, she was referred to a pediatric pulmonologist for evaluation of her stridor.\n\n1. In retrospect, many if not all, of the patient's prior illnesses (migratory arthralgias, ulcerative colitis, and sinusits) were likely a manifestation of Wegener's.\n\n2. Virtual bronchoscopy is an expanding technical application of raw data obtained from CT examinations. Computer \"Navigator\" software converts the raw data into cine-3D images which can be used to simulate bronchoscopy.  In this specific case, virtual bronchoscopy was very helpful to the pulmonologist who determined to limit his actual examination to the larynx due to the stenotic/edematous appearance of the subglottic region seen on virtual bronchoscopy. He did not want to risk further inflamation of the already critically stenotic airway. Video of the actual laryngoscopy confirmed anatomy and pathology seen with virtual images."

            "Title": "Wegener's Granulomatosis",
            "Disease Discussion": "WEGENER\u2019S GRANULOMATOSIS is a systemic vasculitis which most commonly involves the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys and less commonly the eyes, joints, skin, neurologic, cardiac and gastrointestinal tissues.   The disease was first described in 1931 and 1936 by H. Klinger and F. Wegener, respectively.  \n\nETIOLOGY: The cause of Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis is not yet known.  Granuloma formation, altered immune reactivity, immune complex deposition, and altered cellular immune responses are believed to play significant roles.  There may be a genetic predisposition. [1]\n\nINCIDENCE: In the United States, the disease frequency is approximately 1 in 30,000,  with mean age of onset of 40, equal prevalence in men and women, and increased prevalence in whites.  Old data indicated that the disease was rare in children and that children accounted for only 0.1% of cases, but the most recent NIH data demonstrates that children and adolescents account for approximately 15% of affected individuals. [2]\n\nPATHOLOGY: The classic histopathology in Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis involving small arteries and veins, most reliably found on biopsies of the lung. Upper respiratory tract biopsies, including the nasal septum, sinus, and trachea, most often show non-specific acute and chronic inflammation with or without giant cells and generally without true vasculitis.  Renal biopsies typically show focal segmental glomerulonephritis, with crescent formation and necrosis in more severe forms. \n\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: The spectrum of clinical features and organ system involvement in Wegener's granulomatosis is broad.  As a multisystem disorder predominantly involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys, clinical manifestations vary from \"classic,\" with sinusitis, serous otitis media, rhinitis with nasal ulcerations, cough, hemoptysis, and constitutional symptoms, to \"fulminant,\" with rapidly progressive renal failure and respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit management, to \"mild,\" with arthralgias, polymyalgia rheumatica-type symptoms, or inflammatory eye disease as examples. [1] \n\nSinusitis is present at initial presentation in about one half to two thirds of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is seen in 85 percent of cases during the entire course of disease.  A computed tomographic scan of the sinuses is often anatomically more informative than are plain radiographs, especially in the setting of destructive and erosive bone changes. \n\nAlthough laryngotracheal disease in Wegener's granulomatosis may be asymptomatic, clinical presentations may range from subtle hoarseness to stridor and life-threatening upper airway obstruction.  The most characteristic lesion is that of subglottic stenosis, which occurs in up to 16 percent of patients. In pediatric and adolescent patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, the frequency of subglottic stenosis is dramatically increased, reaching an alarming 48 percent. Direct laryngoscopy may reveal active erythematous, friable mucosa or bland scar.  Tracheal tomograms, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance imaging may be useful adjuncts in the diagnosis of subglottic stenosis. Only 20 percent of lesions diminish with immunosuppressivetherapy alone, whereas 80 percent are fixed or irreversible owing to chronic fibrosis. [2]\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS: in the past 15 years, c-ANCA and its relationship to Wegener's granulomatosis have been studied. Clearly, this test is helpful in Wegener's granulomatosis, particularly during active generalized disease, and may be confirmatory. Because reports of false positives are increasing and because sensitivity varies from 30 to 90% in a clinician's diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, depending on the extent of disease and disease activity level, the test cannot be used as a sole diagnostic criterion for Wegener's granulomatosis. Radiologic imaging studies are helpful in diagnosing Wegener's granulomatosis, including chest and sinus radiographs and computed tomography. The differential diagnosis is quite broad and depends on the patient's signs and symptoms. When the classic triad of involvement occurs, with confirmatory tissue biopsy and a positive c-ANCA, the diagnosis is easy. When the process is early and/or limited to the upper airway or kidney, the diagnosis is clinically challenging. [1]\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  Imaging studies of the paranasal sinuses may reveal characteristic findings in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. Plain film findings include mucosal thickening, opacification, air-fluid levels, and bony sclerosis or frank obliteration . Computed tomographic findings include bilateral sinus opacification, orbital mass, bone erosion, septal perforation, and mucosal thickening [3]\n\nTracheobronchial involvement by Wegener\u2019s  manifests on CT as mural thickening and narrowing of involved airways.  90% of inflammatory lesions are located in the subglottic region with circumferential tracheal involvement and narrowing occur with a length of involvement ranging from 5 to 45 mm.  \n\nOn CT, the most common finding of pulmonary Wegener\u2019s is multiple irregularly marginated nodules, which can range from 2 to 20 in number and from 2 to 90 mm in size. Areas of opacification ranging from ground-glass attenuation to frank consolidation are the second most common CT pattern of pulmonary Wegener\u2019s and often represent findings of pulmonary hemorrhage . [4]\n\nTREATMENT:  Treatment depends on the severity and location of the disease.  A multidisciplinary approach is often needed.  Glucocorticoids and cyclophoshamide are the primary medications used for treatment.  Combination therapy with oral daily cyclophophamide and glucocorticoids is considered the standard therapy.  Methotrexate at times is used as an alternative to cyclophosphamide. Surgical treatment is often required to treat sinus disease, tracheal disease, and less frequently to provide renal transplant. \n \nPROGNOSIS:  Whereas Wegener's granulomatosis was once an invariably fatal disease, the combination of cyclophosphamide and prednisone has provided remission in 75% of all patients and improvement in 90%, as evidenced in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) series of long-term follow-up studies. However, relapses occur in at least 50% of those achieving remission at any time from several months to 15 to 20 years after stopping cytotoxic therapy. [2]",

Although choledocholithiasis (bile duct stones) represents a diagnostic possibility in almost any setting of biliary stone disease, certain risk factors should be elicited from the patient to develop a diagnostic perspective.\n\nIn the setting of jaundice, elevated serum bilirubin, and pancreatitis, a dilated common bile duct is should lead to a careful search for distal obstructing stones.  Up to 15% of patients having cholelithiasis, also have choledocholithiasis.  The size of the extrahepatic bile duct is the most sensitive means of determining obstruction (whether seen or unseen).  Furthermore, although there are some special cases, CBD should measure less than or equal to 4mm + 1mm per decade after 40.\n\n\nUltrasound remains up to 95% sensitive in the detection of cholelithiasis. However, detection of common duct stones remains at approximately 80%.  Certain maneuvers (drinking water, using compression with the US probe) and certain positions (RPO, R lateral decubitus) can assist with detection.  Sometimes the overlying bowel & gas can obscure imaging by ultrasound.  A level and cause of the obstruction needs to be obtained to guide the need for further tests, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.  Options include MR cholangiogram, CT, and endoscopic procedures.\n\nAbout 90% of biliary obstructions and subsequent biliary ductal dilatation occur distally and are caused by 3 entities:\n1) pancreatic carcinoma\n2) choledocholithiasis\n3) chronic pancreatitis with stricture formation\n\nIf the diagnosis is uncertain then further diagnostic studies should be undertaken to better delineate these etiologies. \n\nComplications of choledocholithiasis include strictures, complicatiosn of operative procedures, and cholangitis.   \n\nAlthough the clinical setting will dictate\u2014especially in the presence of infection\u2014stones < 6mm typically can pass on their own.

            "Disease Discussion": "Emphysematous cystitis is a rare entity (in 2001, a researcher reported his was only the 166th case in medical literature).  Typical patients are immunocompromised or elderly and debilitated, and 50% of cases are seen in diabetics.  Patients may present with anything from no symptoms to an apparent acute abdomen.  Pneumaturia is rare.  Prevalence in females is twice that in males.  Often associated with urinary stasis, and growth of gas forming organisms (most commonly E. coli, but others include Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Staphylococcus aureus, streptococci. Clostridium perfrigens, and Candida albicans).\n\nPlain abdominal radiographs are generally suffiecient to confirm the diagnosis.  This disease is often not suspected until discovered on the abdominal radiograph.  Findings include curvilinear gas lucencies throughout the bladder, often described as a \"cobblestone\" or \"beaded necklace\" appearance.  Gas may ascend the ureters and reveal an air pyelogram.  In rare cases where plain images are negative despite high clinical suspicion, CT may show intramural bladder gas (as in this case).\n\nThis appearance differs from that of bladder gas introduced by trauma, instrumentation, or vesicocolic fistula, where gas is confined to the bladder lumen, and does not exhibit the curvilinear appearance.\n\nTreatment of emphysematous cystitis involves early broad spectrum antibiotics, drainage of the bladder, and management of hyperglycemia if present. \n\nPrognosis in patients diagnosed and treated early in the disease process is usually good.The development of emphysematous ureteritis, nephritis, or adrenalitis portends a poor prognosis.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Solitary, smooth surface tumors that protrude into the bowel lumen include a carcinoid, leiomyoma, lipoma, adenoma, very rarely an inflammatory fibroid polyp or a neurogenic tumor.  Of these only the lipoma would be soft enough to be flattened by abdominal compression.  The absence of an associated exoenteric mass would be against the diagnosis of carcinoid, a more frequently found small bowel tumor.  Lack of ulceration together with the softness of the tumor would be against a leiomyoma, a slightly more frequent small bowel tumor than a lipoma.  The benign character of this tumor is supported by the long history and its smoothly round surface appearance.\n\nThe benign character of the tumor would have been rendered definite if lack of significant growth could have been shown by a further examination one or two years later.  This could be demonstrated in another case included here to underline this point.  Film .3 is a small bowel meal study done at another hospital in a patient who complained of intermittent pain.  Arrows outline an oval shaped, smooth intraluminal tumor.  The patient's symptoms continued and a small bowel enema was done two years later.  Film .4 demonstrates the same elongated intraluminal lesion which had not appreciably increased in size during the two years; a lipoma was removed at surgery.\n\nAll benign small bowel tumors are rare, leiomyoma and lipoma being the least infrequent.  Though lipomas arise in submucosal fat, their slow growth is deflected by the muscularis and directed into the bowel lumen to make them present like a mucosal polyp.  They will occasionally ulcerate and bleed.  More frequently, they will transiently intussuscept to give rise to crampy abdominal pain, the symptoms of the first patient in this case.  The diagnosis of lipoma can be supported by CT when it would show an attenuation number compatible with fat.\n\nFURTHER CASE EXAMPLE:  A 50-year-old man complained of crampy abdominal pain of sudden onset; stools were heme positive; a small bowel enema (Film .5) outlined an almost 2-cm rounded, intraluminal filling defect with slight surface irregularity (arrow) seen at the top of the film; in the course of the barium study (Film .6) the lesion was seen to intussuscept and advance about 4 cm (arrows indicate the narrow passage through the intussusception).  The differential diagnosis included lipoma, lymphoma (very rare as a single polypoid lesion), carcinoid (they virtually never intussuscept) and inflammatory fibroid polyp (very rare).  The patient later came to laparotomy and a very rare adenoma was resected.",

Lymphoma of the small intestine may also present as an ulcerating mass.  Diagnosis of primary small bowel lymphoma is made by the presence of an isolated small bowel lesion and regional lymphadenopathy without splenic, hematologic, or hepatic involvment.  \n\nThe differential diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin includes adenocarcinoma, carcinoid tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, lipoma, metastases, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.

However, lymphomas of the small bowel make up only 2 % of GI malignancies.  Interestingly, in Western societies GI lymphomas are predominately in the stomach (50-60 %) with only 20-30% in the small bowel, where in the middle east these values are reversed. B cell lymphomas account for 2/3 of GI lymphomas and have a 2:1 male predominance.

However, none of these modalities can assess the cord directly and its relationship to the surrounding structures.  The introduction of MR compatible hardware for spine stabilization and modification of life support devices for use in MR scanning has made imaging of the acutely injured spine possible.  Cord edema and hemorrhage are frequently seen in the acutely traumatized spinal cord.  Cord edema can cause focal enlargement of the cord, but more frequently elongates T1/T2 due to the water content.  This is usually best seen on T2-weighted images as an area of increased signal.  Clinically, it may be important to distinguish an edematous cord from a hemorrhagic contusion (3).  Cord hemorrhages evolve similarly to intracerebral hemorrhage, and therefore acute hemorrhages tend to have low T1 and T2 signal characteristics.  On the T2-weighted sequences, the hemorrhagic low signal portion is often surrounded by a ring of high signal intensity edema.  Finally, cord maceration and transection represent the most severe form of cord injury.  This is usually seen as a loss of cord signal or marked inhomogenity of signal where the cord should be.  In this particular case, the thoracolumbar junction acts as a fulcrum, tending to produce flexion-compression (i.e., burst) fractures, with motion instability and a tendency to produce retropulsion of the fracture fragment.",

            "Title": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm",
            "Disease Discussion": "An aneurysm is defined as a focal dilation of the aorta involving an increase in diameter of at least 50 percent  as compared with the expected normal diameter.  The normal size diameter of the aorta in this area is 2 cm.  The pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysms is multifactorial.  Familial clustering, genetic predisposition, and hemodynamic factors all play a role in the formation of abdominal aortic aneurysms.  The overall incidence of abdominal aortic aneurysm is 15 to 37 cases per 100,000 patient years.  \n\nMuch of the research has focused on the relationship of aneurysm size to the risk of rupture.  Studies using CT and ultrasound have recorded average expansion rates of  0.4 cm per year.  Risk factors for rupture include elevated blood pressure, smoking,  atherosclerotic disease, and the presence of COPD.  Smoking is the major risk factor for aneurysm formation.  Aneurysms can also occur as part of certain disease such as Marfans or Ehler-Danlos syndrome.  The risk of rupture for aneurysms less than 4.0 cm is 2 percent.  For aneurysm greater than 5.0 cm the risk is between 25 to 41 percent.  The risk of rupture for aneurysms between 4 to 5 cm is between 3 to 12 percent.  Immediate repair vs. surveillance for aneurysms less than 5.5 cm has not improved survival. \n\nAbdominal ultrasound can be used as screening tool for abdominal aortic aneurysm.  Ultrasound has sensitivity of 100 percent.  Both the longitudinal and transverse aortic diameters can be measured and there is no need for IV contrast.  Ultrasound can measure aneurysm within a range of 0.6 cm.  Ultrasound is limited in its use for surgical planning because it cannot document the proximal or distal extent of the aneurysm. \n\nCT is highly sensitive and specific for identification of abdominal aortic aneurysms and is more accurate in determining the size of the aneurysm.  CT is also valuable in surgical planning because it provides information on the anatomical relationship of the visceral and renal vessels.  Disadvantages to CT include the need for IV contrast and exposure to radiation.\n\nThe mortality of a ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is over 90 percent, but for those who make it to a hospital alive 50 percent survive.  The classic triad of hypotension, back pain, and a pulsatile abdominal mass is only present half of patients.  Diagnostic tests such as CT or ultrasound should not delay immediate operation.",

            "Title": "Mucocele of the appendix",
            "Disease Discussion": "The term \"mucocele of the appendix\" refers to an accumulation of mucus within an abnormally distended appendiceal lumen, regardless of its cause.  Most mucoceles are, however, probably neoplastic in nature, and thought to be the result of a pathologic spectrum consisting of hyperplasia, mucinous cystadenoma and mucinous cystadenocarcinoma.  Many patients are asymptomatic, and the mass is only discovered incidentally at laparotomy.\n\nAt barium enema, a smooth globular mass indenting the cecum may be seen, associated with non-filling of the appendix.  The combination of appendiceal non-filling and deformity of the inferomedial aspect of the cecum should always suggest the possibility of appendiceal disease, whether this be due to appendicitis (as is usually the case), appendiceal neoplasm or a mucocele.  Occasionally, an inverted appendiceal stump following appendectomy may be sufficiently large (indicated by arrow in Film .3) that it simulates a neoplasm.\n\nOn CT, an appendiceal mucocele typically is seen as a near-water-density rounded mass adjacent to the cecum, with or without peripheral calcification.\n\nRupture of an appendiceal mucocele may give rise to pseudomyxoma peritonei, in which the peritoneal cavity becomes filled with the gelatinous material either in the form of circumscribed collections or lying free.  If this condition is discovered incidentally at laparotomy, a careful search should be made for an underlying tumor which is most commonly ovarian or appendiceal in origin.  CT sometimes shows a characteristic appearance in pseudomyxoma peritonei, with septated fluid-density material in the peritoneal cavity and/or marked deformity and scalloping of the liver by the mucinous material (Films .4 and .5).",

            "Disease Discussion": "Renal infarct is the formation of a necrotic area in a kidney that results from renal blood vessel occlusion.  The size and location of the infarct depends on the site of vascular occlusion.  Occlusion can be either thrombotic or embolic in nature.  Thrombotic events are more likely to occlude large renal arteries or its branches.  Emboli, on the other hand, can cause more distal occlusions resulting in smaller defects and/or multiple ones. Residual renal function after infarction depends on the extent of the damage.\n\nCause:  Most common caused - renal artery embolism secondary to  mitral stenosis.  Other causes include infective endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, microthrombus in the left ventricle, rheumatic valvular disease, or recent myocardial infarction.\nMay also be caused by atherosclerosis with or without thrombus formation, thrombus from flank trauma, sickle cell anemia.\n\nPatients may present with acute or chonic abdominal pain, generalized or localized to affected flank. Occlusive events may also be clinically silent.\n\nOn IVP study, the infarcted portion of the kidney does not excrete contrast and is seen as a defect in a renal contour.  CT through the kidneys after administration of intravenous contrast demonstrates an area of non perfusion.  There may be a rim of enhancement along the cortex.  This occurs when there is enough blood flow from the renal capsular vessels that penetrate into the outer most cortex.\nInfarcted part of the kidney may be revascularized either through collateral, resolution of the thrombus, or by intervention.  If imaged during revascularization phase, the areas of infarct may have heterogenous enhancement.  In the absence of a baseline study, this may cause confusion and difficulty in making the correct diagnosis.\n\nDifferential diagnosis of a non enhancing kidney (part or whole) includes infection, tumor and ischemia.  Secondary signs such as rim enhancement and clinical picture help to offer the right diagnosis.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Lipohemarthrosis is the result of extruded bone marrow fat and blood into joint space following an intraarticular fracture [1].  First described in 1929 by Kling, Holmgren demonstrated the \u201cfat-fluid\u201d level radiographically in 1939 [1,2].  In 1942, Pierce et al. described a fat-fluid level, which had a fluid-fluid component and suggested that this phenomenon was the result of separation of blood into serum and cellular elements [2].  In 1996, Lugo-Olivieri et al. performed a retrospective review of 41 patients with tibial plateau fractures and found that joint effusions with fluid levels resulted from blood separating into cellular elements and supernatant serum, confirmed with CT or MR imaging. Lugo-Olivieri concluded that a single fluid-fluid level on radiographs in a post-traumatic knee did not necessarily reflect lipohemarthrosis, as hemarthrosis could appear similarly.  They suggested that a double fluid-fluid level is a more specific finding for intraarticular fat and an underlying fracture.\n\nLipohemarthrosis is more common in fractures about the knee, but has been described in the shoulder, elbow, and hip fractures [1].  CT and MRI are more specific than radiography in evaluating the composition of the effusion, but sonography may also have a role [1].  The anterior layer on ultrasound will appear hyperechogenic because of the fat. On CT, this area will be fat-density, and will follow fat signal on all MR pulse sequences [1,2].  The supernatant layer will be anechoic on US, fluid density on CT, and follow simple fluid signal on all MR sequences [1,2].  The hemorrhagic cellular layer will appear hypoechogenic on sonography, hyperdense (50 \u2013 70 HU) on CT, and produce intermediate signal on T1 and hypointense signal on T2-weighted images [1,2].",

            "Disease Discussion": "The major complication of esophageal dilation is perforation.  Incidence of this outcome is related to etiology of stricture, technique, operator experience and equipment used.  Overall incidence is estimated at 0.1%.  Perforation may be cervical esophagus, intrathoracic or gastric (as in this case).  Clinical features are dependent on location of rupture, but include dysphonia, hoarseness, subcutaneous emphysema, and/or pain exacerbated with inspiration or swallowing.Appropriate initial studies when perforation is suspected include cervical and thoracic radiographs and gastrograffin swallow (which may be falsely negative in up to 10% of cases).  When clinical suspicion remains high, despite negative swallow, the study may be repeated with barium which has much higher sensitivity, but is extremely irritating to pulmonary tissue.  When both swallows are negative and concern for perforation remains, CT should be performed.Management is usually surgical but, in select cases of early diagnosis without evidence of intrapleural or intraperitoneal extravastion of contrast in a stable patient, medical management may be adequate.  This includes 10-14 days NPO with parenteral nutritional support, antibiotics and drainage of fluid pockets.  Prognosis for patients with perforation due to instrumentation tends to be better than in those occurring spontaneously.  However, in those cases of delayed diagnosis or very elderly patients (such as the one in this case) mortality may be up to 50%.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Liposclerosing myxofibrous tumor (LSMFT) of bone is a benign fibro-osseous lesion that is characterized by a complex mixture of histologic elements, which may include lipoma, fibroxanthoma, myxoma, myxofibroma, fibrous dysplasia\u2013like features, cyst formation, fat necrosis, ischemic ossification, and, rarely, cartilage. Despite its histologic complexity, LSMFT has a relatively characteristic radiologic appearance and skeletal distribution [1]. \n\nLSMFT is usually an incidental finding. According to Gilkey [2], they have a broad adult age range, but quite likely have their inception in childhood and slowly alter their appearance over a lifetime. In the majority of instances asymptomatic discovery, lack of distortion of bone outline, and sclerotic borders are indications of stability over many years. Other lesions gradually enlarge, predisposing to pathologic fracture. \n\nThe designation of \"sclerosing\" refers to the intralesional bone formed or mineralized within altered fat. The term \"myxofibrous\" refers to the fibrous or myxofibrous areas. \n\nThe radiologic appearance of LSMFT is often quite characteristic. LSMFT has a striking predilection for the femur: In a study by Kransdorf, et al, approximately 85% of the lesions were at this site, and 91% of the femoral lesions were in the intertrochanteric region. Radiographs typically showed a geographic lesion with a well-defined, often extensively sclerotic margin. The bone contour was normal or showed mild expansile remodeling. Mineralization within the lesion was not uncommon. \n\nLSMFT can be readily distinguished from intraosseous lipoma on CT scans or MR images by the identification of fat within a lipoma. Intraosseous lipomas do occur in the proximal femur, and the differentiation between LSMFT and intraosseous lipoma with involutional change may not be possible on imaging studies. Similarly, in some cases, differentiation between infarct and myxoma may not be possible. \n\nMalignant transformation in lipomatous lesions has been well documented. The prevalence of malignant transformation in LSMFT has been previously reported to be 10%\u201316%. The increased propensity of LSMFT for malignant transformation is likely to be secondary to its extensive involutional and ischemic change, with the associated sarcoma arising from areas of ischemic ossification within the lesion or from progressive in situ atypism of the altered lipomatous elements. \n\nIn summary, LSMFT of bone is a lesion characterized by a complex admixture of histologic patterns. Although LSMFT is not unique in terms of histogenesis, it is distinctive in terms of its morphologic and characteristic radiologic appearances and skeletal distribution. The apparent increased risk of malignant transformation associated with LSMFT underscores the need for close observation of this condition.",

Additionally, any immunocompromised patient may be affected; organ recipients on immunosuppressive treatment, oncologic and hematologic patients, the elderly, severely malnourished children, and patients requiring prolonged corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe most common radiographic finding in patients with PCP consists of diffuse, bilateral symmetric ground-glass reticulonodular, or finely granular opacities occurring in a perihilar, or lower lung zone distribution.  Less commonly, PCP will occur with upper lobe predominance.  If untreated, these opacities may manifest as diffuse air space consolidation. As the disease progresses, interstitial disease will become more pronounced, and air cysts may be noticed in 5% to 35% of patients.  Occasionally, single or multiple nodules, miliary nodules, cavitation, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, and pleural effusion will be identified.  CT typically demonstrates symmetric bilateral ground-glass opacities, which may be diffuse, or have a mosaic pattern with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung giving a \u201ccrazy-paving\u201d pattern. Spontaneous pneumothorax may be identified in 5% to 10% of patients, and is more common when cysts are present.   Pneumomediastinum may also be evident occurring by itself or in concert with pneumothorax.\n\nMost patients have characteristic radiographic findings of PCP, eliminating the need for CT.  However, in patients with symptoms and atypical radiographic findings, CT may show ground-glass opacities, that when correlated with the CD4+ count and other clinical markers may allow the correct diagnosis of PCP to be made.  Other causes of ground-glass opacities in patients with AIDS include CMV pneumonia and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.\n\nClinically, patients with PCP demonstrate nonspecific complaints.  Fever, cough, progressive dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, night sweats, and chest pain are all common symptoms.  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are frequently elevated, and patients demonstrate restrictive patterns on pulmonary function tests, with hypoxemia when exercising.  Clinicians may employ induced sputums, or use bronchoscopy with BAL to clinch the diagnosis.  BAL which has close to 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity in diagnosing PCP, is useful when positive, however when results are negative, transbronchial or open lung biopsy may be pursued when the clinical findings suggest a high probability of PCP.  Patients will often begin empirical therapy in the absence of definitive diagnosis to avoid potential complications.\n\nSummary: Perihilar and bilateral lower lobe reticular opacities on chest radiography in a patient with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 suggests PCP.",

            "Discussion": "Hydrocephalus is defined as an active distension of the ventricular system due to inadequate passage of CSF from its point of production within the ventricular system to its point of absorption into the systemic circulation (2).  The incidence of hydrocephalus is equal in men and women.  However, there are a few exceptions such as an X-linked hydrocephalus and normal pressure hydrocephalus that is predominant in male patients.\n\nThis 21 yr old woman presented with headache and was diagnosed with aqueductal stenosis.  Headache is the most common clinical manifestation of an adult with aqueductal stenosis.  The signs and symptoms of hydrocephalus vary with age and disease progression.  A symptomatic adult patient could have additional neurological symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, blurred and double vision, gait impairment, drowsiness and cognitive deterioration.  Possible physical exam findings include those due to increased intracranial pressure such as papilledema, failure of upward gaze and accommodation, enlarged head, and gait instability(1).  \n\nBased on the imaging findings, the patient suffered from chronic hydrocephalus because there was no significant transependymal flow of CSF or sulcal effacement .  Chronic hydrocephalus are typically due to congenital causes or longstanding processes, and this patient\u2019s aqueductal septations are likely associated with post-inflammatory changes and sequelae of her childhood case of salmonella meningitis.  The incidence of chronic hydrocephalus increases with increasing age and clinical symptoms appear when hydrocephalus decompensates due to late onset of aqueductal stenosis (3,4).  \n\nIn order to relieve the pressure and improve patient\u2019s clinical manifestation, this patient underwent VP shunt placement.  Currently, there are two forms of surgical treatment for aqueductal stenosis: shunt placement and endoscopic third ventriculostomy.  Shunt surgery remains the standard of care due to its effectiveness, but ETV experience is growing with improving patency rates and avoids shunt malfunction complications.  After obstruction is resolved, a patient\u2019s gait, postural function, cognitive functions may improve (1).  This patient had complete resolution of headache.\n\nReferences:\n1.\tTisell, M, Tullberg, M, Hellstrom, P, Blomsterwall, E, Wikkelso, C. Neurological symptoms and signs in adult aqueductal stenosis.

Congenital abnormalities such as Arnold Chiari and Dandy Walker malformation and acquired diseases such as tumors, infections, and trauma and result in hydrocephalus.  \n\nHydrocephalus can also be divided into communicating and non-communicating hydrocephalus.  In communicating hydrocephalus, the CSF flow is blocked after it exits the ventricles.  It is most commonly due to defective absorption of CSF, venous drainage insufficiency, and overproduction.  In non-communicating hydrocephalus, the CSF flow is blocked along one or more of the narrow passages connecting the ventricles.  The most common cause is Aqueductal Stenosis.

            "Title": "Suspected meningioma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Meningiomas originate from arachnoid cap cells and are the most common extraaxial neoplasms of the brain, representing 15-20% of all brain tumors.  Although it is hormonally sensitive and is three times more common in women, meningioma represents a significant proportion of the extraaxial neoplasms in men and in adults of all age groups.  Most patients present between the ages of 40 and 60 years of age.  Meningiomas are uncommon in children without associated neurofibromatosis type-2.  The most common locations for meningiomas (in descending order) are the parasagital dura, convexities, sphenoid wing, juxtasellar, cerebellopontine angle cistern, olfactory groove, posterior fossa clivus, planum sphenoidale, and tentorium.  Uncommon locations are the ventricles (pediatric patients), with a distinct propensity for the left lateral ventricle, and the optic nerve sheath (adult females).  2-3% occur in the spine.  Less than one percent of meningiomas are extradural and result from embryologic arachnoid rests outside the CNS.  These extradural menigiomas have been found in the interdiploic space, outer table of skull, skin, paranasal sinuses, parotid gland, and parapharyngeal space.  Multiple lesions occur in 1-2% of patients increasing to 30% with a previous history of radiation therapy.\n\nMeningiomas often incite a variable amount of intracranial edema with lesions adjacent to the cerebral cortex tending to cause greater edema than those along the basal cisterns or planum.  However, edema is absent in 40% of cases because of slow growth. The lesions themselves demonstrate calcifications in 20% of cases while cystic areas are seen 15% of the time.  Meningiomas can sometimes demonstrate intraosseous extension or grow through the bone or into the dura.  Hyperostosis or osteolysis occur in 20% to 46% of cases.  Hyperostosis is particularly common when the tumor is at the skull base or anterior cranial fossa where it may resemble fibrous dysplasia or Paget\u2019s disease.  The skull base is the one region where meningiomas can become unresectable because of collateral damage to vital structures.  Occasionally, meningiomas may have necrotic centers.  Thrombosis and, rarely, osteblastic, chondromatous, or fatty degeneration occurs.  Meningiomas may encase and narrow adjacent vessels.  Meningiomas often parasitize pial vessels.  As such, these lesions have both a dural and a pial blood supply.  In the typical convexity or sphenoid wing meningioma, the middle meningeal artery is enlarged.\n\nAtypical meningiomas make up 2.4% of all meningiomas and are classified as WHO grade II.  Atypical lesions must exhibit increased mitotic rates, small cells with high nucleus/cytoplasmic ratio, prominent nucleoli, sheet like growth, and foci of necrosis causing nonhomogenous enhancement.  They look like benign meningiomas radiographically, but recur more frequently.  Hemorrhage is common as are peripheral low density zones from trapped CSF in arachnoid cysts.\n\nMelignant meningiomas are classified as WHO grade III, are uncommon and are usually diagnosed when intraparenchymal invasion, markedly rapid growth, or sarcomatous degeneration has taken place, most likely arising from benign tumors gone awry.  The papillary variety of meningioma undergoes malignant differentiation more commonly than the rest.  Higher grade is associated with a higher rate of recurrence.  Survival varies with the site, size, grade, and extent of surgical removal of tumor.\n\nRadiation therapy induces five times more meningiomas than it does schwannomas or sarcomas.  Diagnosis of radiation induced meningioma is made if the meningioma arises in the radiation field, appears after a latency period (of years), was not the primary tumor irradiated, and is not seen in a patient with neurofibromatosis.  Low dose radiation treatment for tinea capitis has been associated with meningiomas following a latency period of about 35 years.  Recurrence rates are higher in radiation-induced meningiomas than in non-radiation induced tumors.\n\nOn unenhanced CT scan, 75% of meningiomas are slightly hyperdense while 25% are isodense to normal brain parenchyma.  Strong, homogenous enhancement is a hallmark (90%).  Signal intensity is similar to normal falx on enhanced and nonenhanced CT.  Calcifications are seen in 20% of lesions and cystic areas are present in 15% of tumors.  The tumors appear round and unilobulated with sharp margins.  A lobulated, extraaxial, parasagittal mass with a dural tail is a typical finding on CT scan.  Rarely, they may appear en plaque, with pancake-like spread along the dura.  Extension of tumor or dural reaction along a dural surface is not uncommon and is known as a \u201cdural tail\u201d which is suggestive, but not specific for meningioma.  Bony erosions are rare, but are more common with malignant meningiomas, where as hyperostosis is more common and more often associated with benign nature.\n\nTumors are typically isointense to gray matter on MRI with strong gadolinium enhancement.  MRI is the best technique for detecting the dural tail.  Increased vascular flow voids within and around the lesion are characteristic.\n\nAngiographic characteristics include a spoke-wheel appearance with dense venous filling, a persistent tumor blush (\u201ccomes early and stays late\u201d) with well demarcated margins and a dural vascular supply.  The middle meningeal artery may be enlarged.",

            "Discussion": "This patient illustrates the challenges of caring for patients en-route.  In the United States, many patients with significant trauma are evaluated at a trauma center, resuscitated at that same center and receive definitive care all within one hospital.  In the military this is different as they may pass through many different facilities on their way back to the US for definitive care in a relatively short time.  A complete set of images may not always be available and the Radiologist must try to look at repeat scans to figure out what interventions may have been done prior to the patient\u2019s arrival and what are the remaining complications.  Often the patients may not be aware of what surgeries they have had because they were unconscious and are unable to provide accurate histories.\n\nThis is illustrated in trying to follow the even number rule of GSW\u2019s.  For each entrance wound, it is important to see either an exit wound or a bullet.  If we do not see a paired wound or bullet with an entrance wound it is important to keep searching because the bullet may have embolized or we are missing the exit wound.  In patients who have received care en-route it is possible to have a violation of this rule because the bullets may have been removed during previous surgeries at different facilities.\n\nThis patient had a repaired diaphragm laceration before reaching our facility which is evidence by 2 clips in the left hemi-diaphragm.  Penetrating diaphragm injuries tend to be smaller (length 1-2cm) and more subtle than blunt diaphragm injuries.  The signs used for detecting blunt diaphragm injury are not as useful in assessing penetrating diaphragm injuries.  One early and specific sign of PDI is herniation of abdominal fat through the injury into the thorax.  If a wound tract is seen on both sides of the diaphragm the specificity of this sign is reportedly 100% (sensitivity 36%).  The diaphragm can also be abnormally thickened when being compared to the contralateral hemidiaphragm due to hematoma, edema, or muscle retraction.  One must have a high index of suspicion when evaluation for penetrating diaphragm injuries."

            "Disease Discussion": "Typically, penetrating diaphragm injury is difficult to diagnose without a high index of suspicion.  Penetrating diaphragm injuries (PDI) tend to be smaller than blunt diaphragm injuries.  PDI\u2019s typically are \u22641-2 cm in length.  Diaphragm injuries are most easily diagnosed at laparotomy but not all patients have indications for an initial laparotomy.\n\nIn trauma, a chest radiograph is typically the first imaging modality employed.  This can be helpful in the initial evaluation for inspecting the integrity of the hemi-diaphragms but patient positioning and the quality of portable films can limit their usefulness.  Many patients with trauma ultimately undergo a CT study.  Multiplanar reconstructed images have been reported by some to be helpful in detecting diaphragm injuries.  There are fewer studies on the use of CT with PDI, one small study by Larici, et al. reported a sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 79% of detecting PDI\u2019s with helical CT.  \n\nHerniation of abdominal fat into the thorax is one sign that is commonly used to detect blunt diaphragm rupture can still be used when looking for PDI.  The most specific sign of PDI is a wound tract that is found on both sides of the diaphragm.  This has a reported specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of 36%.

Cross-sectional imaging abnormal findings are uncommon and include mild organomegaly and the identification of MR hypointense or CT hypodense nodules, which represent coalescent granulomas.  These imaging findings are not specific for sarcoidosis however, and metastatic disease and lymphoma cannot be excluded, although involvement of both the spleen and liver favors sarcoidosis and lymphoma as differential possibilities.  Evaluation of the laboratory data, to include tumor markers, can be helpful in determining the presence of malignancy.  In the absence of other evidence of sarcoidosis, liver biopsy is advised.

            "Discussion": "Saccular (berry) aneurysms are rounded outpouchings that arise from arterial bifurcation points.  They most commonly arise secondary to abnormal hemodynamic shear stresses, and are not congenital as previously believed.  Berry aneurysms can also be associated with trauma, infection, tumor, drug abuse, AVM, and AVF. \n\n15-20% of cases are multiple.  They are found in the COW / MCA bifurcation 90% of the time.  Most berry aneurysms become symptomatic between 40 and 60 years of age, commonly presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, with an associated high mortality and morbidity rate.  The risk of rupture is 1-2% annually.  There is a 20-50% rebleed risk.  Larger size correlates with increased rupture risk, but there is no critical size that can be used to predict risk for bleed.  When a berry aneurysm is discovered, aneurysm obliteration is necessary, because of the poor prognosis for subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nCT:  In the case of a patent aneurysm, a well-delineated iso/hyperdense lesion that exhibits uniform intense enhancement is demonstrated.  In the case of a thrombosed aneurysm, the residual lumen and outer rim may enhance strongly.  No enhancement is seen in complete thrombosis.\n\nMR:  Appearance can be highly variable, secondary to varied flow characteristics.  Patent aneurysms can demonstrate a hyper or hypointense signal depending on flow.  Wall enhancement may occur.  Thrombosed aneurysms demonstrate flow void signal surrounded by concentric layers of clot. \n\nReferences:\n\nCebral JR, et al.

            "Disease Discussion": "Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is also known as renal adenocarcinoma, hypernephroma, clear cell carcinoma, and malignant nephroma.  It is responsible for approximately 2% of adult malignancies.  Male-female ration is 1.5:1.  Age at presentation ranges from 50 to 70 years, with a median age at diagnosis of 57 years. Risk factors for RCC inclued tobacco use, long-term phenacetin use, Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHLD), chronic dialysis, and family history.\n\nBilateral RCC commonly develops in patients with VHLD, tuberous sclerosis, acquired cystic kidney disease and familial RCC.  Bilateral neoplasms occur in less than 2% of patients with sporadic RCC.  This tumor may spread via local extension, hematogenously, or by the lymphatic system. \n\nROBSON CLASSIFICATION FOR STAGING OF RCC:\n     I    - Tumor confined to renal capsule\n     II   - Tumor extends throught renal capsule but is confined    \n            to renal fascia.  Ipsilateral adrenal may be involved\n            in this stage\n     IIIA - Tumor involves renal vein, IVC, or both\n     IIIB - Tumor involves regional lymph nodes\n     IIIC - Tumor involves regional nodes and renal venous structure\n     IVA  - Direct extension of tumor through renal fascia to \n            involve adjacent organs besides ipsilateral adrenal\n     IVB  - Distant metastases\n\nTreatment options include surgery (radical or partial nephrectomy), angioinfarction (arterial tumor embolization), hormonal therapy (e.g. progestins, antiestrogens, and androgens), chemotherapy, immunotherapy (Interferons), and radiation therapy.  Tumor embolization may be used to minimize blood loss during surgery or to produce palliation. Objective tumor regression after treatment with hormonal agents is achieved in less than 6% of patients. Immunotherapy is mainly used in patients with metastatic RCC after resection of primary tumors with successful results in about 20% to 30% of patients with 5% to 10% complete responses. RCC is relatively radioresistant tumor. The role of radiation therapy is primarily in preoperative reduction in the size and fixation of tumors.\n\nCT FINDINGS IN RENAL CELL CARCINOMA\n     - Most occur in the renal cortex and demonstrate an exophytic growth pattern.  They distort the renal contour and larger tumors involve both the renal cortex and medulla.  Solid tumors may be hyperdense, hypodense, or hyperdense on non-enhanced CT. Some lesions may appear heterogenous on non-enhanced scans because of hemorrhage and necrosis.  Tumor calcification occurs in approximately 30% of cases.  They may also rarely demonstrate small amounts of adipose tissue.  A combination of fat and calcification shoud suggest RCC because fat-containing AMLs do not usually calcify. Solid RCCs usually demonstrates heterogenous enhancement(>10 HU).  2% to 5% of RCCs are predominantly cystic. Filling defects (clots, tumor thrombus) in the collecting sytem and renal veins may be seen.",

AML is identified most frequently in middle-aged women, and may be seen in patients diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis.  In patients without tuberous sclerosis, AML is most often unilateral in location, whereas patients with tuberous sclerosis frequently demonstrate multiple, small, bilateral AMLs.\n\nPatients with AML smaller than 4 cm are generally asymptomatic.  If an AML is found to be larger than 4 cm, the presenting signs or symptoms are typically hematuria and or flank pain, and the tumor is resected secondary to an increased risk of hemorrhage.  Additionally, if the tumor size is 1 cm or larger, thin section CT should be performed to evaluate for the presence of fat.  If fat is not identified on CT, then the diagnosis of Renal Cell Carcinoma should be entertained.  Small, asymptomatic AMLs should be followed for evidence of growth.\n\n\n\u2022  Ultrasound \n\nAngiomyolipoma (AML) may have a varied acoustic pattern as the amount of adipose tissue, smooth muscle, and blood vessels vary from lesion to lesion.  Generally, AML is a homogenous well defined hyperechoic cortical neoplasm arising from the renal parenchyma, with echogenecity similar to that of the renal sinus.  Occasionally, AML may appear as a hypoechoic focus when smooth muscle, blood vessels, or hemorrhage constitute the majority of the lesion.

            "Title": "Meningioma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Epidemiology and Location\nMeningiomas comprise approximately 20% of adult intracranial tumors, have a female predominance, and occur most often during middle and older ages.  They may be found in intracranial and intraspinal compartments.  In the head, meningiomas are most commonly located in frontal, parasagittal, and parietal convexities (50% of cases). Less than 10% of tumors are infratentorial; multiple meningiomas occur less than 10% of the time.  Clinical presentation is varied, depending on particular structures compressed by the mass. Headache and visual changes are frequently reported.  A large number of patients with meningiomas are asymptomatic.\n\nOrigins, Growth, and Histology\nThe majority of meningiomas are histologically benign tumors, arising from the cap cells of the arachnoid layer. In many cases, serial imaging studies have revealed a cessation of growth after the time of initial tumor detection. These tumors project inward from the dura, and can cause clinically significant effects due to compression of surrounding neurological structures.  A variety of classification systems based on cytology and histopathology are used with meningiomas.  While the overwhelming majority of meningiomas are histologically benign, the malignant type may result in rapid, widespread infiltration with small (microscopic) \"finger\" projections into adjacent cortex.  In patients with malignant meningiomas, marked deficits in physical and mental status may culminate in death.\n\nRadiological Findings\nPlain films may reveal hyperostosis, erosion, or calcification adjacent to tumor site.  Noncontrast CT's of meningiomas often reveal sharply demarcated, rounded, homogenous masses with slightly increased density when compared to surrounding cortex.  Up to 10% of meningiomas may appear isodense with respect to surrounding brain.  CT may reveal focal cerebral atrophy, edema, or widening of subarachnoid spaces, direct effects of tumor compression of surrounding structures.  Contrast enhanced CT most often reveals homogenous enhancement in approximately 85% of cases.\n\nOn MRI, T1 images are often hypo- or isointense; T2 images often reveal isointense or slightly hyperintense masses. Gadolinium increases signal intensity of meningiomas. A  \"dural tail\" consisting of tissue tapering into the dura may be appreciated.  Imaging studies may reveal extension of mass into cortical structures, or invasion of the calvarium. Angiography often reveals a homogenous, hypervascular pattern.\n\n\nTreatment Options\nA variety of clinical and experimental treatment options exist, including surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.  Resection is the most widely utilized treatment option, although advanced age, concern about loss of neurological function due to surgery, advanced age, and being a poor surgical candidate preclude some from surgical options. Tumor embolization may be employed 3-5 days prior to surgery in an attempt to decrease blood supply to the meningioma. Recurrence of tumor is a possibility after resection. Complete removal of initial tumor and all affected bone results in recurrence rates of less than 10%.\n\nRadiotherapy is often employed during the presurgical period.  Likewise radiotherapy after incomplete resection of a meningioma may be of considerable benefit to patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery with a \"gamma knife\" has shown decrease in tumor size in approximately 50% of cases.  Since this technology is relatively new, long term outcome of gamma knife therapy is not known. Brachytherapy with iodine-125 has been described in the literature; long term outcomes have yet to be determined. Medical treatment options include recommendations of anticonvulsant prophylaxis in patients with supratentorial masses; corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling may also be warranted.  The use of traditional antineoplastic agents in treating meningiomas has not been met with great success.  Hormonal manipulation may have a beneficial effect on stopping tumor growth; research this area continues.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Lesions/Condition: Hepatic Congestion secondary to Congestive Heart Failure\n\n\nDiscussion:  \n\nPassive hepatic congestion is caused by stasis of blood within the liver parenchyma due to the compromise of hepatic venous drainage.  It is a common complication of congestive heart failure and constrictive pericarditis, wherein elevated central venous pressure is directly transmitted from the right atrium to the hepatic veins because of the their close anatomic relationship.  The liver becomes tensely swollen as the hepatic sinusoids dilate and engorge to accommodate the back flow of blood.  Liver dysfunction arises from a combination of decreased hepatic blood flow, elevated hepatic venous pressure, and diminished arterial oxygen content, resulting in hepatocellular hypoxia.\n\nHepatic changes are manifested as hepatomegaly, ascites, jaundice, and abdominal pain caused by stretching of the liver capsule.  Transient abnormalities of the liver-associated enzymes include elevations of serum bilirubin, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time. The transaminase levels are typically elevated 20-fold but normalize rapidly over several days.  Passive hepatic congestion typically occurs in elderly individuals with right-sided congestive heart failure and low cardiac output.  Precipitating factors include cardiac ischemia, dysrhythmias, cardiac or extracardiac infection, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, noncompliance with medical therapy, and dietary indiscretion, to name a few.  Symptoms include weakness, shortness of breath, and right upper quadrant pain. \n\nLaboratory:\n\nIn right-sided heart failure, hyperbilirubinemia may be evident, and the transaminases are moderately elevated.  Occasionally, there is isolated elevation of cholestatic enzymes.  In left sided failure, there is a more marked elevation of  serum bilirubin and of transaminases, which rapidly return to normal when congestive heart failure is treated.\n\n\nSonographic Evaluation:\n\nPatients normally demonstrate inferior vena caval and hepatic venous triphasic flow patterns.  The first two peaks are toward the heart and are reflections of right atrial and ventricular diastole.  The third peak is a short period of reversed blood flow, accompanied by atrial systole.  As central venous pressure rises, the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins dilate because the failing right atrium cannot accommodate the venous return.  Clinically, this is manifested by a hepatojugular reflux on physical examination.\n\nWith elevated central venous pressure, the hepatic veins lose their triphasic pattern.   In long-standing disease, a unidirectional, low-velocity, continuous flow pattern may be seen.  Mixed flow patterns can also be seen on color flow Doppler sonograms. \n\nNormal portal venous flow is steady and continuous except for a mild increase during expiration.  In patients with passive hepatic congestion, the energy of the elevated pressure from the right atrium and hepatic veins is transmitted directly via the dilated hepatic sinusoids into the portal vein.  The result is that portal venous blood flow becomes pulsatile, because the liver no longer prevents changes in central venous pressure from reaching the portal circulation.\n\nAdditionally, sonographic evaluation of the gallbladder may demonstrate diffuse gallbladder wall thickening, which is a nonspecific finding, found in a variety of conditions unrelated to intrinsic gallbladder disease.  Edema of the gallbladder wall, as seen in congestive heart failure, is likely secondary to elevated portal venous pressure, elevated systemic venous pressure, and decreased intravascular osmotic pressure.  However, passive edema of the gallbladder wall may be difficult to differentiate from other causes of gallbladder wall thickening such as an acute inflammatory process in the right upper quadrant, acute pancreatitis, perforated duodenal ulcer, hepatitis, right-sided diverticulitis, and acute right-sided pyelonephritis. \n\nWhen the above findings are considered with other ancillary findings of congestive heart failure to include cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, hepatomegaly, and ascites, one should have little difficulty in arriving at the proper diagnosis of passive hepatic congestion secondary to congestive heart failure.",

These symptoms are directly related to the involvement of the temporal lobes, insular cortex, and orbital surface of the frontal lobes by this disease.\n\nAfter initial contact through infected secretions in the oronasopharnyx, HSV-1 travels via the lingual portion of the trigeminal nerve, to the gasserian ganglia where the virus remains dormant.  Upon reactivation from the influences of local trauma, immunosuppression, or stress, or the result of primary infection, the virus spreads in a retrograde fashion along the fibers that innervate the leptomeninges of the anterior and middle fossa.\n\nEarly diagnosis and rapid therapy is essential, as herpes encephalitis progresses rapidly.  The mortality rate ranges from 50% to 70%, with those surviving left with significant neurological impairment to include amnesia, dementia, seizures, and aphasia.  Both the patient\u2019s age and level of consciousness at the time of initiation of intravenous acyclovir dictate outcomes.  If the patient is unconscious prior to beginning therapy, the outcome is poor.  If the patient is awake, and treatment is begun within 4 days of onset of the illness, survival is greater than 90 percent. \n\nLaboratory:\n\nCSF demonstrates increased pressure and a pleocytosis with lymphocyte predominance.  \nRed cells, and xanthochromia are identified in a minority of cases, secondary to hemorrhage.  Protein content is increased, and CSF glucose may rarely be lower than 40 mg/dL.\n\nPolymerase Chain Reaction may be employed to identify HSV antigen in the CSF while the virus is replicating in the first few days of the illness.\n\nPathology:\n\nGross Pathologic Features: \n\nHemorrhagic and necrotizing encephalitis of gray and white matter, with severe edema and tissue necrosis localized to the inferior frontal, temporal lobes, and insular cortex.  \n\nMicroscopically:\n\nFocal necrotizing vasculitis with perivascular inflammatory infiltrates, with eosinophilic Cowdry intranuclear inclusion bodies located in neurons, and glial cells.\n\nHerpes viruses include HSV-1, HSV-2, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, B virus, HSV-6, and HSV-7.\n\n\nRadiology:\n\nThe imaging findings of HSV encephalitis on CT may be initially normal or subtly abnormal.  Generally, abnormalities are not identified until 3-5 days after the onset of significant symptoms.  Common initial findings are low attenuation in the medial temporal lobes and insula, with mild mass effect.  Hemorrhage may occasionally be identified and is a late finding that is highly suggestive of herpes encephalitis.  On contrast enhanced CT, there is ill-defined patchy enhancement, with gyriform enhancement being a late finding.  \n\nMRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting early changes, and demonstrates signal changes in almost all sequences.  T1 weighted images demonstrate areas of low signal intensity with surrounding edema localized to the temporal lobes, insular cortex, subfrontal area, and cingulate gyri.  Loss of the gray-white matter differentiation, and evidence of mass effect is frequently encountered.  Additionally, in cases of hemorrhage, there may be foci of increased signal in the inferior parts of the frontal and temporal lobes.  T2 weighted images demonstrate asymmetric bilateral high signal intensity in gray, and subcortical white matter of the temporal lobes, extending into the insular cortex, secondary to edema.  The basal ganglia are usually spared.  Findings are initially unilateral, followed by less severe contralateral temporal lobe signal abnormalities.\n\nProton density sequences demonstrate increased signal intensity in affected areas.  T2 weighted Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) sequences demonstrate hyperintense signal with edematous cortex and subcortical white matter.  T2 gradient recalled echo sequences show hypointensity if there is hemorrhage within the edematous brain parenchyma.  \n\nDiffusion weighted images demonstrate marked hyperintense restricted diffusion, and reduced ADC values.  It is important to distinguish these findings from ischemic stroke, hemorrhage, abscess, lymphoma, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, glioma, and metastatic disease, for the determination of appropriate treatment.  HSV encephalitis can be differentiated from other high signal intensity DW MR images, and low ADC values based on the clinical presentation of the patient, distribution of the imaging findings, and results of the polymerase chain reaction test.\n\nT1 weighted gadolinium enhanced images demonstrate asymmetric mild patchy enhancement indicating abnormalities of the blood-brain barrier.  Gyriform enhancement may be seen one week after initial symptoms.  Meningeal enhancement is an early finding, with parenchymal enhancement being a late finding, or evidence of hemorrhage.\n\nMR spectroscopy may be utilized demonstrating elevated peaks of lactate, choline, and myoinositol, and reduced N-acetylaspartate signal. \n\nFollow-up imaging demonstrates progressive abnormalities with worsening involvement of the contralateral temporal lobe, insula, and cingulate gyri.  Encephalomalacia, atrophy, and dystrophic calcification are commonly seen as sequelae of HSV encephalitis.",

Most appear as a triangular or oval-shaped mass in the medial and basal portion of a lung and more are commonly left (extralobar 90%, intralobar 60%). Extralobar sequestrations are always airless. Intralobar sequestrations are mostly airless though there may be \"collateral air drift\" via the pores of Kohn. Most are clinically silent until they become infected and can present as recurrent pneumonias. Extralobar sequestrations often present in neonatal life and intralobar in older children and adults.\n\nAlso included in the category of thoracic anomalies are: pulmonary agenesis (pulmonary artery and lung bud are absent), pulmonary aplasia (pulmonary artery and lung parenchyma are absent but a blind-ending bronchial stump exists), unilateral pulmonary hypoplasia/scimitar syndrome with aberrant pulmonary venous return* (small RIGHT pulmonary artery with hypoplasia of all or part of RIGHT lung AND partial anomalous drainage of the pulmonary veins - subdiaphragmatic into IVC, hepatic or portal veins), unilateral pulmonary hypoplasia secondary to congenital diaphragmatic hernia, bilateral pulmonary hypoplasia (incompatible with life), congenital lobar emphysema (isolated and progressive hyperinflation of a single lobe likely secondary to dysplasia, hypoplasia, or immaturity of bronchial cartilage in involved lobe), CCAM or Congenital Cystic Adenomatoid Malformation (abnormal proliferation of terminal respiratory structures lacking mature alveoli resulting in a cystic mass structure, usually unilobar), bronchogenic cysts (bronchopulmonary foregut malformation likely secondary to an ectopic bronchial bud which communicates with the tracheobronchial tree), esophageal duplication cyst (bronchopulmonary foregut malformation usually of distal esophageal wall), and neurenteric cyst (failed separation of pulmonary and notochordal elements in 3rd gestational week).

            "Title": "Neurocysticercosis",
            "Disease Discussion": "Cysticercosis is a parasitic infection caused by Taenia solium, the pork tapeworm, which is endemic to Central and South America, southern Africa, and Asia. The prevalence is often higher in rural areas, particularly where pigs are raised and poor sanitary conditions prevail. Humans develop cysticercosis by ingestion of foods contaminated with the parasites eggs (typically fruits & vegetables), not from eating pork infected with the parasite itself as is popularly believed. Thus, individuals who have never eaten pork can still acquire cysticercosis.\n  \nOnce eggs are ingested by humans, the embryos are released in the small intestine and invade the bowel wall. They then disseminate hematogenously and develop into cysticerci over a period of 3-8 weeks. Cysticerci are liquid-filled vesicles consisting of a membranous wall and a nodule containing the invaginated scolex. The scolex has a head armed with suckers and hooks and a rudimentary body. Humans with cysticercosis are incidental dead end hosts.\n  \nThe most prominent manifestations of cystircercosis infection involve the CNS, a syndrome referred to as neurocysticercosis (NCC) and it is thought to be the most common parasitic infection of the brain.  Clinical syndromes of cysticercosis are therefore often divided into neurocysticercosis and extraneural manifestations.\n  \n80% of neurocysticercal infections are asymptomatic. Consequently, many cases are found accidentally during imaging procedures or at autopsy. When symptoms due occur, they may be due to mass effect, an inflammatory response, or obstruction of foramina and ventricular system of the brain.\n  \nCysticerci that enter the CSF do not initially cause much inflammation. The host develops immune tolerance to the parasite, and cysticerci can remain in this stage for years without eliciting symptoms. Clinical manifestations frequently develop when an inflammatory response develops secondary to a degenerating cysticercus. It is not known what triggers this degeneration, but after a number of years the cyst loses its ability inhibit the host immune response. Peak presentation with NCC is estimated to occur 3-5 years after infection. After a variable period of degeneration, cysts become calcified and inactive. Once inactive, they may cease to cause symptoms or may serve as a focus for epileptic activity.\n  \nActive parenchymal disease is the most common form of NCC and is present in >60 percent of patients. Cysticerci tend to lodge in the cerebral cortex or basal ganglia. The cysts are usually <1 cm. Patients with parenchymal NCC frequently present with seizures, occurring in 50-80% of patients. In many endemic countries, NCC is the most common cause of adult-onset epilepsy. Because of NCC, the prevalence of epilepsy is almost twice as high in developing countries as it is in the Western world.\n  \nNeurologic examinations are usually normal, but focal neurologic signs or headache may be present. Patients rarely have fever or signs of meningeal irritation. If a patient has massive numbers of cysts in the brain parenchyma, an intense immune reaction can occur, resulting in encephalitis. This reaction can occur spontaneously or it can be provoked by therapy. This presentation is most common in children and young females for unknown reasons. \n  \nCysticerci that lodge in the subarachnoid space may grow to 10 cm or more since they are not limited by pressure from the brain parenchyma. Cysticerci can also develop in the ventricles of the brain, either floating freely in the ventricular cavity or attached to the choroid plexus, and is seen in only 10-20% of cases. Mobile cysts in the forth ventricle can occasionally cause intermittent obstruction, leading to episodes of sudden loss of consciousness related to head movements (Bruns' syndrome).    Involvement of the spinal cord occurs in approximately 1-3% of cases of NCC. Spinal cysticerci can be intramedullary or located in the subarachnoid space. \n  \nExtraneural cysticercosis typically involves the eye, muscle, or subcutaneous tissue. Patients with ocular involvement may have parasites located in the subretinal space or vitreous humor. These are often asymptomatic, but inflammation around degenerating cysticerci can threaten vision by causing chorioretinitis, retinal detachment or vasculitis and therefore this entity should be excluded before initiating therapy. Cysticerci also have a predilection for muscle or subcutaneous tissues, however, cysticerci at these sites are usually asymptomatic. \n  \nCalcified cysticercal lesions in muscle or subcutaneous tissue may be seen on routine skeletal radiographs or intracranial calcifications may be seen on skull x-rays.  Any case of suspected NCC needs to be evaluated with a CT scan or MR imaging. The appearance depends upon the location and stage of the lesions and upon the host immune response. In parenchymal NCC, viable cysts are seen as nonenhancing hypodense lesions. Degenerating cysts may enhance with contrast and may have variable degrees of surrounding inflammation. Old cysts often appear as calcified lesions.  MRI is preferred over CT scanning, since MRI is more sensitive in detecting small lesions, brainstem or intraventricular lesions, and is better at visualizing the scolex. MRI is also more useful in evaluating degenerative changes in the parasite. However, CT scanning is better at detecting small areas of calcification.\n  \nA number of different serologic tests have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of cysticercosis. Some tests detect anticysticercal antibodies, and others identify cysticercal antigens. Some can only be performed on blood, while others can done on other fluids, such as CSF or saliva. As with all serologic tests, results need to be interpreted with caution in individuals from highly endemic areas where a positive serology may be due to past infection and may not prove current active disease.",

            "Discussion": "Esophageal cancer is the 10th leading cause of deaths due to cancer in the United States and continues to be the 19th among cancers in incidence. The two main types are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Although squamous cell constitutes 95% of esophageal cancers worldwide, adenocarcinoma has steadily increased to be the major histological type in the US since the 1970s.\n\nAdenocarcinoma affects white males in the 6th or 7th decade and is most commonly located in the distal esophagus.  Risk factors include gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett\u2019s esophagus where there is replacement of normal squamous lining with intestinal-type columnar epithelium.  Interestingly, these histological changes were found in patients without reflux symptoms. In a Swedish population-based study, 40% of patients with cancer did not have symptoms at least weekly.  In comparison, squamous cell cancer of esophagus is located in proximal-mid esophagus, affects black males, and is commonly associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption. \n\nCommon presenting symptoms of esophageal cancer are dysphagia, weight loss, GERD odynophagia, and dyspnea. These symptoms, especially any evidence of mechanical obstruction, should prompt an upper endoscopy where biopsies can be obtained. The primary tumor can then be imaged suing CT and endoscopic ultrasound. CT provides a general overview of the cancer and demonstrates adjacent organ involvement, although esophageal wall layers are not easily distinguished. EUS is gaining popularity due to its strength in visualizing the wall layers. Its drawbacks include operator skill and viewing \u201chard to reach\u201d tumors. \n\nOnce the diagnosis of the tumor is made, imaging to rule out metastatic disease should be performed. Intravenous-contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis remains the gold standard although sensitivity is dependent on the size of the lesion. MRI and US modalities can be used to further characterize metastatic lesions. Positron Emission Tomography is a new tool that visualizes the higher rate of glucose uptake by malignant tissue versus normal, thus, providing more information about metastatic disease. \n\nAppropriate imaging allows clinicians to properly stage the tumor, which directly affects the treatment options and prognosis. Well localized tumors can be resected and have the best 5-year survival of 65-85%. More invasive tumors and those with distant metastses are not surgical candidates and are treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy for palliation. The overall 5yr survival of esophageal cancer is 12-15%.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nElton, Eric. \u201cEsophageal Cancer,\u201d Disease-A-Mouth, V51, N12 (2005) 664-684.\n\nKorst, R and Altorki,N. \u201cImaging for Esophageal Tumors,\u201d Radiologic Clinics of North America 43(2005) 611-619.\n\nPatel, A and Buenaventura, P. \u201cCurrent Staging of Esophageal Carcinoma,\u201d Surgical Clinics of North America 85 (2005) 555-567."

            "Disease Discussion": "Adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal (GE) junction is notable in that its incidence that increased more than any other malignancy in the western world.  The reasons for such an increase are unknown. (1)  There are three classifications of this type of cancer:  Type I mainly involves the distal esophagus, Type II is primarily located at the GE junction, and Type II mainly involves the subcardial/proximal stomach region. (3)  GE junction adenocarcinoma can either arise from the esophagus or proximal gastric area.  It is very difficult to determine the primary cancer site. (1) Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma include familial adenomatous polyposis, gastric adenomas/ dysplasia,  chronic atrophic gastritis,  gastric metaplasia, diet high in nitrates, and Helicobacter pylori infection.  Risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma include smoking, obesity, and Barrett\u2019s esophagus- patients affected with Barrett\u2019s esophagus have a 30-40% higher chance of developing cancer. (4)  \n\nRadiological evaluation of GE adenocarcinoma should be able to determine tumor spread and response to chemotherapy.  The sensitivity of CT for detection of distant metastases ranges between 50% to 90%.  Of those shown to have only local disease with CT, FDG-PET detected metastatic disease in approximately 20% more cases. In addition, esophageal ultrasound (EUS) can differentiate between stages T1/T2 and stages T3/T4 with an accuracy > 90%.  Assessment of tumor response to chemotherapy by FDG-PET correlates with tumor regression proven by histology and can predict patient outcome as early as 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. (5)",

            "Disease Discussion": "The term appendicolith is preferred over the less specific terms, coprolith and fecolith.  Approximately 10% of patients with acute appendicitis have a radiographically visible appendicolith.  One third of surgically removed appendices, however, contain an appendicolith.  The calcification may form around any type of nidus, including a piece of vegetable matter, swallowed foreign body, or even barium.  The appendicolith tends to be round or oval, smooth, and laminated (Film .2Z).  The size varies, but stones in the l-2 cm range are common with stones up to 4 cm in size having been reported.  The location is usually in the right lower quadrant, but the pelvis, right upper quadrant in the case of retrocecal appendix, and even the left upper quadrant may be the site.  \n\nThe differential diagnosis includes the following:\n\n\ta) Phlebolith - these rounded calcifications tend to occur in clusters, are usually lower in the pelvis, and frequently contain a central lucency.\n\tb) Calcified lymph node - these tend to be amorphous, irregular, \"popcorn\" calcifications.\n\tc) Ureteral calcifications - this calcification should conform to the course of the ureter and tends to be smaller and less often laminated.\n\td) Benign bone island in the iliac wing - this density will not move with changes in position of the patient, maintaining a constant location within the iliac bone.\n\nThe presence of an appendicolith is significant clinically since patients with this radiograph finding are more likely to have appendicitis complicated with perforation or abscess.  This is especially true in children.  \n\nThe plain film diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the absence of an appendicolith can be difficult with the plain film demonstrating abnormalities in approximately one half of patients.  The following radiographic findings have been described, but no one of these is as helpful as an appendicolith.  \n\n\t1) Abnormal bowel gas pattern.  The bowel gas pattern in acute appendicitis can be anywhere from normal to consistent with a complete small bowel obstruction.  A local ileus in the right lower quadrant with air fluid levels can be seen.  Occasionally fluid-filled right lower quadrant small bowel loops may present as a soft tissue mass.  A dilated transverse colon in pediatric patients with a perforated appendix has also been described.  \n\t2) Abnormal cecum and ascending colon.  Local inflammation and edema may cause thickening of the colon wall and widen the haustra.  A cecal air fluid level may be present.  \n\t3) Extraluminal soft tissue mass.  This finding can be seen in up to one third of patients with perforation.  A combination of edema, fluid, and fluid-filled loops of small bowel produce the effect.  A mottled gas collection within the soft tissue mass is highly suggestive of an abscess.  \n\t4) Obliteration of normal fat planes.  Sufficient inflammation from appendicitis may alter the water density of the surrounding fat and obscure the right properitoneal flank stripe, psoas muscle, or obturator muscle.  \n\t5) A small amount of free intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal air may rarely be present.\n\nThe use of the barium enema, ultrasound, and CT in diagnosing acute appendicitis will be discussed in a separate section.",

Approximately 40% of cases of medullary nephrocalcicosis are attributable to primary hyperparathyroidism, another 20% to renal tubular acidosis, and the remaining 40% divided among many other causes.  Most of the conditions that cause nephrocalcinosis can also result in nephrolithiasis.  Their coexistence helps establish the etiology and may significantly impact patient management.  The appearance of medullary nephrocalcinosis equates to calcifications involving the distal convoluted tubules in the loops of Henle.\n    \nHYPERCALCIURIA, in general, is due to to dissolution of the bone, excessive ingestion or absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract, or faulty renal reabsorption of calcium.  Hyperparathyroidism is the most common single cause.  Medullary nephrocalcicosis is seen in 5% of those with primary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid adenoma), and nephrolithiasis is seen in 50-80% of these patients.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism (usually due to renal disease) is a much less likely cause.\n\nRENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS is characterized by abnormal renal tubular function that results in chronic systemic acidosis and a persistent alkali urine.  There are two types of RTA.  Type II RTA consists of proximal abnormalities, in which there is a greater than normal loss of bicarbonate, and renal calculi are not formed.  Distal tubular dysfunction (type I RTA) interferes with hydrogen ion transfer into the urine, and may result in stone formation. 30% of infants and 70% of adults with type I RTA develop medullary nephrocalcicosis or nephrolithiasis.  RTA may cause delayed skeletal maturation and osteomalacia.  Primary RTA results from an inherited enzymatic defect.  Diseases known to cause secondary RTA include Wilson\u2019s disease, Fanconi\u2019s syndrome, hyperglobinemias, nephrotoxic drugs (outdated tetracycline, amphotericine B), and acetazolamide administration.  These processes (primary or secondary causes of RTA) result in an inability to acidify urine.  Since calcium ions are much more soluble in acidic urine crystalline calcium salts precipitate.\n\nRENAL TUBULAR ECTASIA, or medullary sponge kidney, is a disease in which the terminal nephrons and ducts of Bellini are dilated.  Calculi form in about half the cases owing to stasis of urine in these dilated ducts.   Approximately 15% of these patients develop calcifications, which may be present in both kidneys, one kidney, or even a single collecting system.\n\nMedullary nephrocalcicosis and urolithiasis occur in a variety of other conditions, including but not limited to sarcoidosis, Cushing syndrome diabetes insipidus, hyperthyroidism, milk-alkali syndrome (excess calcium + alkali = milk + antacids), and hypervitaminosis D.",

            "Discussion": "The initial brain MRI showed scattered lesions consistent with thromboembolic phenomena.\n\nThis patient had suspected thromboembolic disease with a cardiac origin. In a patient of this age and with his history of atrial fibrillation and aortic stenosis, left atrial thrombus and infective endocarditis were high on the differential for the embolic source.\n\nThe patient underwent two transthoracic echocardiograms (TTEs) evaluating for possible endocarditis. Both TTEs were negative for atrial thrombus, and neither could effectively image the aortic valve due to the high level of valvular calcification present. It should be noted that TTE has a relatively low sensitivity (high false negative rate) for visualizing left atrial appendage thrombi compared to TEE and cardiac-gated CT.\n\nA transesophageal echocardiogram was bypassed after the patient was deemed not to be a good surgical candidate (based on age and comorbidities); this cardiac-gated CT scan was later performed instead to evaluate for the embolic source. The CT scan showed no evidence of infective endocarditis, but did reveal a filling defect within the left atrial appendage. Of note, single-phase contrast imaging with cardiac-gated CT can have a falsely positive filling defect in the left atrial appendage, especially in cases of atrial fibrillation when the atria may be dilated and/or there is little contractility to allow adequate contrast mixing within the appendage. Key to this study is the late-phase imaging, which showed contrast filling the atrial appendage and highlighting the presence of a thrombus. This finding was pathognomonic. \n\nCardiac tumors, including atrial myxomas and papillary fibroelastomas (as well as metastatic disease), are other possibilities, but are considerably more rare; thus, they remain low on the differential diagnosis."

            "Title": "Left atrial appendage thrombus",
            "Disease Discussion": "The three classic mechanisms for thrombus formation include blood flow stasis, blood vessel wall damage, and a hypercoagulable state. All three of these are thought to contribute to the development of thrombi in patients with atrial fibrillation. This has considerable clinical relevance, with atrial fibrillation being a major cause of thromboembolic disease leading to serious morbidity and mortality.\n\nWhile thrombus formation is possible anywhere within the heart depending on variations in anatomy and function of the atria, ventricles and valves, the left atrial appendage is of particular interest. Low blood velocities in the atrial appendage result in high incidences of thrombus formation compared to elsewhere in the heart. Roughly 90% of thrombi in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation arise in, or associated with, the left atrial appendage. It is thought that the anatomy of the appendage, with its relatively small communication to the left atrium and the presence of trabeculations, predisposes the area to low blood flow. In patients with atrial fibrillation, atrial contractile function decreases significantly, and there is relative blood stasis in the appendage leading to thrombus formation.\n\nTraditionally, the left atrial appendage has been best evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography (TEE); while more invasive than transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), TEE was found to be much more effective at visualizing thrombi in the atria and the left atrial appendage. More recently, cardiac-gated computed tomography (CT) angiography has been shown to have thrombus detection values very similar to that of TEE (sensitivity and specificity values near 100%). Cardiac-gated CT may become the preferred modality for evaluation of suspected thromboembolic disease from a cardiac source in cases where TEE is not tolerated or non-diagnostic.\n\nThrombus formation in patients with atrial fibrillation is counteracted in the majority of moderate to high risk patients with warfarin therapy. However, a sizable proportion of patients are unable to take oral anticoagulation therapy due to contraindications or are non-compliant. For this reason, there are techniques used to close the left atrial appendage, either in an open approach during surgery (for valve replacement, for example) or, more recently, with percutaneous devices. Long term outcome studies are still pending, however, left atrial appendage occlusion may become a viable method for stroke prevention in patients unable to take oral anticoagulants.",

However, in this case the complaint of back pain in this patient with fever was actually elicited only after the In-111/WBC scan findings were known. In the case of a photopenic lesion of the spine with In-111/WBC the differential diagnosis is: osteomyelitis, infarction (late), metastasis, overlying hardware or bone resection, radiation effects, myelofibrosis, and Paget\u2019s disease (lytic phase). In-111/WBC has a high accuracy in the diagnosis of osteomyelitis except for within the spine. Ga-67 uptake, while more sensitive for spinal osteomyelitis is less specific, being seen in any situation where there is bone turn over, to include fracture or osteomyelitis. In this case, MR was obtained to evaluate the photopenic lesion seen on the In-111/WBC scan. MR findings of osteomyelitis would include decreased SI in the marrow on T1, variable  SI on T2 and enhancement with gadolinium, all of which are seen in this case. However, findings that argue in favor of metastatic disease are the involvement of the pedicles, and sparing of the adjacent discs and surrounding tissues.",

            "Disease Discussion": "ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION (AVM)\n\nClinical Features:  AVMs are the most common symptomatic congenital vascular malformations.  The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related\u201d aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

            "Disease Discussion": "The history of a sudden onset unilateral motor and.or sensory changes in a patient are strongly suggestive of stroke, which can be generally classified as either ischemic or hemorrhagic.  Although this patient had no known history of hypertension, her CT and MRI both demonstrate evidence of chronic small vessel ischemia secondary to longstanding hypertension.  The differential diagnosis for a hemorrhagic lesion in the putamen/posterior capsule includes lacunar infarct, hypertensive hemorrhage, vascular malformation, and neoplasm.\n\nLacunar infarcts represent 15-20% of all strokes, and appear as small cavitary lesions in subcortical regions.  They result from the thrombosis of a small penetrating artery, often as a result of a chronic hypertensive change known as lipohyalinosis.  Characteristic locations for lacunar infarcts include the following:  putamen (37%), pons (16%), thalamus (14%), caudate (10%), and internal capsule (10%).  Posterior limb lacunes are the most important clinically because of their potential for severe motor and sensory deficits.  Anterior limb lacunes are often clincally silent.\nThese \"perforating\" arteries (lenticulostriate aa., thalamogeniculate aa., and anterior choroidal branch of ICA) are common sites for both lacunar infarcts and hypertensive hemorrhage, and both types of lesions can result from a process known as lipohyalinosis.  This is the impregnation of hyaline-lipid material into the walls of small arteries in the setting of hypertension combined with atherosclerosis.  Lipohyalinosis predisposes the artery to thrombosis and may also weaken the vessel wall, resulting in small dissecting \"Charcot-Bouchard\" aneurysms.\n\nHypertensive hemorrhages are slightly less common than lacunar infarcts, representing 10-15% of all strokes.  Two-thirds of hypertensive hemorrhages occur in the putamen, but most cases occur in the presence of systolic blood pressures much higher than 170.  Active bleeding usually lasts less than one hour, while edema progresses over the next few days.  Complications of hypertensive hemorrhage include brain herniation and hydrocephalus.",

            "Title": "Pheochromocytoma with metastases to the left celiac lymph node",
            "Disease Discussion": "Adrenal masses are found on CT both when evaluating for a specific disease and also incidentally (the \u201cincidentaloma\u201d) while evaluating for another non-specific complaint.    The incidence of incidentalomas has been estimated to be as high as 1.4% to 10% based on autopsies, but in actual practice occur at a frequency of .35% to 5%.         \n\n       Amongst the various imaging modalities available to the clinical/surgical team, CT is the most useful for evaluating adrenal masses.  Utilizing 5 mm collimations, tumors as small as 10 mm may be detected.  Although not accepted in clinical practice, multiple studies indicate that low HU masses are more likely to be benign than malignant.   One series indicates that masses less than 18 HU are benign (85% sensitivity, 100% specificity).  Another set of studies states that those less than 10 HU are benign (73% sensitivity, 96% specificity).   Another factor to consider in evaluation for malignancy is the size of the lesion.  The greater the size of the lesion, the greater the likelihood of adrenal carcinoma versus adenoma.  Lesions less than 3 cm on CT are unlikely to be malignant, whereas lesions greater than 6 cm are usually carcinomas.  In addition metastases tend to be less then 4 cm in size.\n      Plain films, ultrasound, and tomograms are not as sensitive, whereas angiography, and scintigraphy are too invasive.  MRI is indicated if malignancy or a pheochromocytoma is suspected.   On T1 or T2 weighted MRI, a benign adrenal adenoma will have the same signal intensity as the surrounding adrenal tissue.  On the other hand, a pheochromocytoma will have a very high signal intensity relative to the surrounding tissue on T2 weighted MRI.  An adrenal carcinoma will be hyperintense relative to the liver, but less so than a pheochromocytoma; and metastatic lesions will similarly have a high signal intensity but not as high as a pheochromocytoma.  Dynamic gadolinium enhanced MRI has been demonstrated to have over 90% specificity and sensitivity in differentiating benign from malignant adrenal masses.\n       Fine needle aspiration is very fine for differentiating metastatic versus primary adrenal tumor with 80-100% sensitivity.  However, it is not quite as good at differentiating benign versus malignant primary tumors (54-86% sensitivity).   However, this is countered by the fact that primary adrenal tumors are usually greater than 6 cm, whereas metastatases are usually less than 4 cm.\n       Other imaging modalities include nuclear scintigraphy with cholesterol radiotracers (I 19-iodocholesterol and selenomethylnorcholesterol [scintiadren]).  Non hypersecrecting adenomas and tumors secreting cortisol, aldosterone and androgen demonstrate increased uptake. \n      One other powerful and exciting imaging modality is positron emission tomography scanning, particularly when fused with CT scans.  PET has proven to be 100% sensitive and specific in differentiating benign and metastatic lesions.  18-F-fluorodeoxyglucose imaging and 131-I MIBG imaging have been used for pheochromocytomas.  111-In octreotide imaging is also used.\n       85-90% of pheochromocytomas originate from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla.   The other 10% are extramedullary in origin and more properly termed paragangliomas.  The vast majority are benign with just 10% of them being malignant.   While we are tossing tens around, 10% of pheochromocytomas are found in childhood, 10% are familial, meaning that they are found in certain syndromes.\n      Pheochromocytomas cause paroxysmal or persistent hypertension due to excess epinephrine/normetanephrine production.   However, only .1-.3% of hypertensive patients have this as cause of hypertension.  Less than half of the patients with pheochromocytoma present with paroxysmal hypertension.  The majority have chronic hypertension, or chronic hypertension with overlying lability.  Paroxysms can be triggered by stress, exercise, posture change, palpation, smoking, and even urination.  Other symptoms include tachycardia, palpitations, headache, sweating, tremor, anxiety and a sense of impending doom. Less frequent symptoms include abdominal or chest pain, nausea and vomiting.  Hypertension can lead to CHF, pulmonary edema, MI, ventricular fibrillation and CVAs.  Catecholamine cardiomyopathy describes the damage to the heart due to pheochromocytoma:   the process of cardiac  ischemic damage secondary to catecholamine induced vasomotor constriction of myocardial circulation or direct toxicity from catecholamines.\n    Occasionally, pheochromocytomas elaborate other steroids or peptides, leading to syndromes such as Cushing\u2019s.  Classically, however, catecholamine secreting pheochromocytoma is diagnosed by increased urinary excretion of catecholamines, their metabolites (VMA), and metanephrines, and the imaging modalities described above.  Certain medications may confound diagnosis by falsely elevating catecholamines.  These include TCAs, BZDs, amphetamines; labetalol, L-dopa, methyldopa, clonidine, and alcohol.\n      Pheochromocytomas occasionally (10%) occur in familial, mainly autosomal dominant syndrome including : MEN II a or II b, tuberous sclerosis, von Hippel-Lindau, von Recklinghausen and Sturge-Weber syndrome.  Familial forms occur mainly in childhood with a male preponderance.  Non-familial forms typically occur between 40-60 years of age with a slight female preponderance.\n      After diagnosis, pheochromocytomas must be localized with the use of CT, MRI, MIBG, and PET scans.  98% are found in the abdominal cavity, but pheochromocytomas can be found anywhere from the base of the skull to the pelvis, in a para-aortic or para-vertebral location.  Occult pheochromocytomas are classically found in the bladder, or in the organ of Zuckerkandl (which is located superior to the branching of the inferior mesenteric artery, anterior to the aorta).\n      Pheochromocytomas must be removed surgically.  It is absolutely essential to modulate catecholamine release pre-operatively by administering alpha blockers (usu phenoxybenzamine 40-160 mg QD divided) in sufficient dose to cause nasal stuffiness or borderline hypotension. Beta blockade with propanolol to control excess beta stimulation (tachycardia/cardiac arrhythmia) is doen AFTER alpha blockade.  Otherwise peripheral perfusion may be compromised.  Volume replace for adequate circulating volume if necessary.  Utilize a midline or transverse incision to explore the adrenals bilaterally and explore the paraaortic and paracaval retroperitoneum from diaphragm to pelvis.  Laparoscopic adrenalectomy utilizing a flank, retroperitoneal or transabdominal approach is a newer technique which offers lower morbidity, and decreased hospital stay.  However, the surgeon must be sure to localize all tumors in advance via imaging studies.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Vertebral artery dissections may occur after head and neck trauma or spontaneously. Cervical artery dissections, including vertebral and carotid arteries, are the leading cause of stroke in patients under 45. In adults, there is no predominance between men and women. \n\nCommon clinical features associated with vertebral artery dissection include neck pain, headache (often posterior/occipital), Horner syndrome, tinnitus, audible bruits, or symptoms of TIA/stroke.\nA dissection of the artery can occur between the media and adventitia, between the intima and media, or a combination of both. The dissection can result with stenosis, occlusion, aneurysmal dilation, intraluminal thrombus formation, or extravascular hemorrhage.\n\nRadiographic evaluation for vertebral artery dissection can be complicated by false negatives and false positives. The most common radiographic techniques used for evaluation include CT and MR. Common causes of false positives include turbulent flow simulating stenosis or adjacent structures that mimic hematoma, or patient body habitus. False negatives are often related to lack of inclusion of the affected area in the study field. Often times, evaluation of headache which may be secondary to dissection results in imaging of the head without inclusion of the neck, although the majority of vertebral dissections occur in the cervical neck. \n\nTreatment for vertebral artery dissection often involves antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. The highest risk of ischemia secondary to dissection is in the first several days after the dissection occurs. Repeat imaging to confirm stability and/or revascularization is recommended prior to discontinuing treatment.",

Adenoma sebaceum, mental retardation and seizures are commonly seen.  The disease affects the whole body with retinal hamartomas, shagreen patches, ungual fibromas, rhabdomyomas of the heart, angiomyolipomas of the kidney, cystic skeletal lesions, and intracranial manifestations also seen.\n\nPathology/Imaging:\n95% of patients show hamartomas, including periventricular subependymal nodules, cortical and subcortical peripheral tubers, white matter lesions, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas.  Periventricular subependymal nodules appear calcified and rarely enhance.  The tubers and white matter lesions are commonly located in the frontal lobes.  The tubers show high intensity on T2WI while the white matter lesions do not typically enhance.  These lesions appear as curvilinear or straight, thin bands extending from the ventricles.  Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas arise from the degeneration of the subependymal nodules.  They enhance moderately, show high signal intensity on T2WI, and are located at the foramina of Monroe.  These astrocytomas typically cause hydrocephalus and show a low rate of calcification.  However, these astrocytomas only occur in 1.7 to 15% of cases.  \n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\nDifferential diagnosis of giant cell astrocytoma is central neurocytoma, ependymoma, subependymoma, and a colloid cyst.\n  \nTreatment:\nResection of the GCA or shunting to treat hydrocephlaus.",

Fibrous dysplasia is a nonheritable disease related to a sporadic mutation in the gene that encodes the subunit of a stimulatory G protein on chromosome 20.

Malignant transformation occurs less than 0.5% of cases. \n\nFibrous dysplasia represents approximately 5% of all benign bone tumors. Any bone can be affected. 70% of cases are the monostotic form whereas 30% are of the polystotic form. The incidence rates are equal in males and females. However the true incidence is unknown since many patients are asymptomatic.  Fibrous dysplasia usually presents in persons aged 3-15. Most cases manifest themselves before the age of 30. Clinically patients present with pain and deformity or with a pathologic fracture. Long bones are commonly affected. The femur is the most common long bone affected. Other common areas include the tibia, facial bones and skull. \n\nThe diagnosis is typically made with plain radiography. Characteristic radiographic findings include a relatively homogenous lucent lesion with or without bone expansion commonly described as a ground-glass appearance. Additionally the lucent lesion has a thick sclerotic border that is called the rind sign. There should be an absence of periosteal reaction. CT is commonly used to assess complex areas such as the spine, pelvis, chest and craniofacial bones. CT is very useful in evaluating the extent of disease in these complex areas. Nuclear imaging may also be used in conjunction with other imaging modalities to assist with the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia. However nuclear imaging is not specific for fibrous dysplasia. Needle biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis if there is uncertainty.\n\nAsymptomatic patients do not require treatment. Bisphosphonates have been shown to be helpful treating chronic bone pain associated with fibrous dysplasia. Surgical treatment is indicated for the treatment and prevention of pathologic fractures.

            "Disease Discussion": "Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that causes symptoms by excessive secretion of catecholamines. The majority (>90%) of pheochromocytomas are found in the adrenal glands. A 10% rule for pheochromocytomas says that 10% are malignant, 10% are bilateral and 10% are extra-adrenal. They occur with equal frequency in males and females and can occur at any age. The classic symptoms include episodes of headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis and severe hypertension.  24 hour urine tests for catecholamines, metanephrines and VMA are helpful for diagnosis. A new plasma free metanephrines assay has higher sensitivity of 99% compared to 63% for VMA and 83% to 85% for urinary or plasma catecholamines. \n   \n    Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas can occur anywhere that sympathetic nervous tissue exists. Two common locations are the organ of Zuckerkandl and the bladder wall. CT and MRI have high sensitivity for detection of pheochromocytomas. CT is faster, less expensive and generally more available than MRI, but is less specific for distinguishing adrenal pheochromocytoma from other masses.  MRI is more specific for pheochromocytoma, but not as well tolerated as CT.  A nuclear medicine scan with I-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine is more specific and is particularly useful in cases where pheochromocytoma is stronly suspected clinically but not visualized anatomically by CT or MRI as it can screen the entire body for a focus of uptake. The false-negative rate of MIBG scintigraphy is 10%. \nCT typically demonstrates a large adrenal mass without calcification on the non-contrast CT.  If contrast is given the tumor may have heterogenous enhancement.  Contrast is not essential for detection and usually is not given if pheochromocytoma is suspected due to reported cases in which iodinated contrast caused precipitation of hypertensive crisis.   CT is reported to be more than 93% sensitive and 95 % specific for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas.  \n   \n   The differential diagnosis for large necrotic adrenal masses include adrenal cortical carcinomas and metastases, but in the context of confirmatory laboratory values the diagnosis can be made with near 100% accuracy.\n   \n   \n   RadioGraphics 2004;24:S87-S99\n    \n   >>Pheochromocytomas are often clinically silent, and the diagnosis can sometimes be first made at imaging. Although an incidental adrenal nodule is unlikely to represent a pheochromocytoma, additional endocrine investigation is warranted if there is any clinical suspicion for this tumor. As with every imaging interpretation, radiologists should be cognizant of the individual patient\u2019s clinical history and, in particular, of his or her blood pressure status. Despite the fact that most pheochromocytomas have high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, more than 30% have low signal intensity on these images. Although pheochromocytomas usually show increased uptake on FDG PET scans, results at conventional radionuclide imaging can also be inconsistent. However, new PET radioisotopes may allow more consistently accurate tests in the future, and these tests may soon play a larger role in the imaging evaluation of both incidental adrenal masses and suspected pheochromocytomas. Pheochromocytoma currently remains a true imaging chameleon, and its diagnosis should always be considered in the imaging evaluation of a patient with an adrenal mass, hypertension, or characteristic symptoms.\n\n    Most pheochromocytomas have an attenuation higher than 10 HU; rarely do they contain sufficient intracellular fat to have an attenuation of less than 10 HU. Still, some pheochromocytomas could be incorrectly categorized as adenomas. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas with macroscopic fat may also be seen. Conversely, some pheochromocytomas may demonstrate very high attenuation due to hemorrhage. << RadioGraphics 2004;24:S87-S99",

            "Title": "Schistosomiasis Japonicum",
            "Disease Discussion": "Organism(s): Schistosomiasis Japonicum \n\nSchistosomiasis (aka bilharzias or \u201csnail fever\u201d), is a chronic parasitic illness that, although rare in the United States, affects between 200 to 300 million people across the world, with another 600 million people at risk of contracting the infection.  This disease is endemic to 74 countries to include Central and South America, Egypt and other African nations, the Middle East, Asia (particularly rural areas in China), and India.  The infection is brought to the United States by immigrants and travelers returning from endemic areas.  \n\nThe main species of blood flukes or Schistosomes to infect humans are S. mansoni, S. japonicum, S. mekongi, and S. haematobium.  The first three species characteristically affect the gastrointestinal tract (inhabiting the portal veins) and the latter typically affects the urinary tract (inhabit veins of bladder) and is the most common cause of bladder calcification in the world.  The incidence in males is nine times greater than in females.  Risk factors include but are not limited to extreme poverty, lack of public health facilities, and poor sanitary conditions.  Infection most commonly occurs in adults who live in rural areas and/or who work in either the agricultural or freshwater fishing fields.\n\nRoute of Infection: Schistosomiasis is a chronic infection caused by parasitic trematode worms that currently affects 200 million people in subtropical and tropical environments and is not an insignificant threat to deployed military members. Schistosomiasis infection in humans begins with cercariae penetration of the skin or buccal mucosal from a contaminated water source.  Schistosome ova are subsequently deposited within the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and genitourinary tract and a granulomatous and fibrotic reaction ensues, resulting in a multisystemic and often nonspecific clinical manifestations.  Schistosomiasis is major cause of portal hypertension worldwide and can potentially result in permanent gastrointestinal and urinary system damage if not appropriately treated. \n\nClinical:  Clinical manifestations can be separated into three different phases: acute, chronic, and severe.  Also known as Katayama fever, the acute phase is usually found in children or young adults who have not had any prior exposure to Schistosomes.  Believed to be the result of high antigen exposure, this early phase is more commonly associated with S. japonicum infections.  Clinical manifestations of this early phase include: dermatitis, bronchospasm, fever, malaise, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia; amongst other nonspecific complaints.  The chronic phase, which is usually subclinical, is characterized clinically by diarrhea and fevers.  There may be related growth rate depression, hepato- and/or splenomegaly, and complications of hepatic fibrosis (i.e. portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, varices of the esophagus and related hemetemesis).  \n\nThe most frequent cause of death in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is gastrointestinal bleeding.  Bladder fibrosis may contribute to ureteral obstruction, pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis which can lead to renal failure.  Bladder infection has been linked with the development of bladder carcinoma.  The severe phase of disease, unlike the chronic phase, is typically symptomatic.   \n\nThe Schistosome has a complex life cycle: humans are infected through contact with contaminated fresh water.  The pathophysiology of gastrointestinal calcification is related to the Schistosome fluke eggs deposited in tissues and not caused by the flukes themselves.  Following deposition of these Schistoma fluke eggs within the venules of the urinary tract (most commonly the bladder and distal ureters), and gastrointestinal tract lumen, there is development of a hypersensitivity or granulomatous reaction and fibrosis around the Schistosome eggs.  The severity or degree of calcification correlates with the number of eggs deposited.  Many of the eggs are swept back into the liver, where they become lodged within the parenchyma and result in hepatic calcification, fibrosis and associated portal hypertension.   \n\nClinical manifestations can be separated into three different phases: acute, chronic, and severe.  Also known as Katayama fever, the acute phase is usually found in children or young adults who have not had any prior exposure to Schistosomes.  Believed to be the result of high antigen exposure, this early phase is more commonly associated with S. japonicum infections.  Clinical manifestations of this early phase include: dermatitis, bronchospasm, fever, malaise, diarrhea, lymphadenopathy, and arthralgia; amongst other nonspecific complaints.  The chronic phase, which is usually subclinical, is characterized clinically by diarrhea and fevers.  There may be related growth rate depression, hepato- and/or splenomegaly, and complications of hepatic fibrosis (i.e. portal hypertension, hepatosplenomegaly, ascites, varices of the esophagus and related hemetemesis).  \n\nThe most frequent cause of death in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis is gastrointestinal bleeding.  Bladder fibrosis may contribute to ureteral obstruction, pyelonephritis, and hydronephrosis which can lead to renal failure.  Bladder infection has been linked with the development of bladder carcinoma.  The severe phase of disease, unlike the chronic phase, is typically symptomatic.   \n\nThe diagnosis can be readily made through the identification of eggs in stool in S. japonicum and S. mansoni infection or by detecting eggs in urine in S. haematobium infection.   Other more aggressive means of definitive diagnosis include liver, rectal, or bladder biopsy.  Additonal nonaggressive yet relatively sensitive diagnostic tests include oval precipitaiton testing and an intradermal immunological skin test for the Schistosome antigen.  \n\nImaging can play a role in demonstrating the extent of organ involvement and complications of Schistosomiasis infection.  Conventional radiography may be the initial means of detecting calcification of the bladder or distal ureters (parallel linear radiodense appearance).  Intravenous pyleogram (IVP) or cystography in particular are very good studies for demonstrating ureteritis cystica, ureteral stricture (or dilation), hydronephrosis, mucosal irregularity, urolithiasis, decreased bladder capacity, bladder tumor, and inflammatory pseudoployps.  CT is useful and more sensitive than radiography for the detection and characterization of urolithiasis and pyelonephritis.  \n\nNodular hepatic lesions have been demonstrated sonographically and by CT in acute Schistosomiasis.  In the colon, extensive curvilinear or tram-track calcifications have been identified in patients with schistosomiasis japonica. Another study involving intravenous contrast-enhanced CT in Schistosomiasis japonica hepatic infection, showed septal, amorphous, and capsular contrast enhancement patterns.  This study concluded that septal enhancement may suggest the diagnosis of hepatic schistosomiasis japonica, particularly when calcification is not identified on noncontrast CT study.  The most reliable diagnostic techniques for detecting chronic bladder disease are cystoscopy, serology, CT and to a lesser extent urography.  Urinalysis in chronic disease may result in missed detection of disease that would otherwise be identified during the early phase of disease.  \n\nhttp://tmcr.usuhs.mil/tmcr/chapter2/intro.htm",

PVT occurs in 10 percent of patients with cirrhosis and frequently accompanies hepatocellular carcinoma.  PVT may be associated with systemic or local infection or mesenteric inflammation.  PVT can complicate pregnancy, especially eclampsia, and conditions causing portal venous stasis such as hepatic venous obstruction, chronic heart failure, and constrictive pericarditis.  Encasement of the portal vein by pancreatic, gastric, and other malignancies can also lead to PVT.\n\nSigns and symptoms of PVT depend on the location and extent of the thrombus, how rapidly PVT develops, and the nature of any underlying liver disease.  PVT may lead to segmental atrophy and infarction.  It can be acutely fatal when associated with mesenteric vein thrombosis.  Collateral channels form and the portal vein recanalizes (cavernous transformation) in 1/3 of patients in whom PVT develops slowly (subacute or chronic).  Portal vein thrombosis can cause or exacerbate portal hypertension.\n\nAs in this case, the predominant clinical feature is often the underlying disease.  However, bleeding from esophageal varices is a frequent presentation.  The presence of splenomegaly and absence of ascities are common findings.\n\nCT findings may include (1) increased size of the portal vein, (2) hyperdense thrombus on noncontrast CT or low density, nonenhancing intraluminal thrombus on contrast enhanced CT, (3) low density filling defect on contrast CT/lack of contrast medium enhancement of the portal vein, (4) failure to visualize the portal vein, (5) canvernous transformation (nest of collateral veins in the porta hepatis), and (6) calcification within the thrombus. T1WI reveals hperintense  portal vein thrombus and numerous portal flow voids (collaterals).  Ultrasound is the best screening imaging modality.  Thrombus appears echogenic and collaterals and varices are often seen.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Incidence rates for sarcoidosis vary greatly from country to country and depend, among other factors, on race, the sophistication of medical care, and the use of screening programs.  Quoted figures are in the order of 1 to 10 cases per 100,00 population per year, but this is almost certainly an underestimate as many cases remain subclinical.  Sarcoidosis occurs with about 10 times greater frequency in blacks than in whites.  \n\nPresentation is most common between 20 and 40 years of age.  The mode of presentation varies among series, depending on racial mix and the use of screening radiography.  In white-dominated series, presentation as an incidental radiographic finding is common and may occur in 40-50% of cases.  Respiratory illness, erythema nodosum, ocular symptoms, and other skin lesions represent the other common presentations.  In predominantly black series, respiratory and systemic symptoms like fatigue, malaise, weakness, weight loss, and fever are most common.\n\nA firm diagnosis for sarcoidosis can be made with consistent clinicoradiologic findings and histologic evidence of widespread non-caseating granulomas in more than one organ or a positive Kveim skin test.  In clinical practice the organs most commonly sampled are lymph nodes, liver, and lung. \n\nLaboratory investigations also show elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels.  Serum ACE levels correlate with degree of total body granuloma burden and the activity of clinical disease as a whole but not convincingly with the degree of and activity of pulmonary disease.  \n\nSarcoidosis can be managed conservatively.  If treatment is indicated then steroids are the agents of choice.  Indications for treating chest disease are not firmly established but most patients with symptomatic or progressive stage II or III disease will be on treatment.  There is no doubt in the short-term efficacy of steroids but the long-term value is less clear.  The majority of deaths from sarcoidosis are related to pulmonary or cardiac disease. \n\nSarcoidosis is commonly staged according to its appearance on the chest radiograph:\n\nStage 0 \u2013 clear\nStage I \u2013 node enlargement only\nStage II \u2013 node enlargement and parenchymal shadowing\nStage III \u2013 parenchymal shadowing only\nStage IV \u2013 Fibrosis with distortion and bullae\n\nThe stage at presentation is generally considered to correlate with prognosis.\n\nLymphadenopathy is the most common intrathoracic manifestation of sarcoidosis.  Symmetric, bilateral hilar adenopathy with some form of paratracheal adenopathy is the classic pattern.  Fluctuation in nodal enlargement during intermittent steroid treatment is well recognized.  Sarcoid nodes may calcify.\n\nParenchymal shadowing is seen at the time of presentation in a little under a half of the patients with sarcoidosis.  A practical division is that between reversible and irreversible opacities.  \n\nReversible changes consist of three patterns:  reticulonodular opacities, ill-defined opacities with characteristics of consolidation (alveolar), and large nodules.  These patterns can occur alone or in varying combinations.  They may resolve partially or completely, or they may progress to a irreversible, fibrotic pattern.  Such fibrosis ranges from minor and radiologically undetectable, to gross with scar-like shadowing and distortion on the chest radiograph.\n\nOn HRCT, sarcoidosis is characterized by mid-upper zone peribronchovascular thickening and irregularity with small nodules distributed in a perilymphatic fashion: along bronchovascular margins, along interlobular septa, and subpleurally (including fissures).  The most common and almost universal finding is small, 1 to 5 mm nodules, usually with irregular but sharp borders.  \n\nFocal opacities larger than 1cm in diameter maybe cause by localized areas of consolidation \u2013 alveolar sarcoid \u2013 characterized by ill-defined margins and an air bronchogram.  \n\nGround glass opacity is seen in about 40% of patients.  It is patchy and may have a lobular distribution.  Ground glass opacity is usually produced by multiple granulomas rather than alveolitis.\n\nScarring causes a number of signs: lobular distortion, traction bronchiolectasis, honeycombing, and cyst or bullae formation.  Nodules, consolidation, ground-glass opacity, and septal lines are potentially reversible.  On the contrary irregular course lines, cysts, honeycombing, bronchiolectasis, and distortion are permanent.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Patent Ductus Arteriosus\nPatent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA) results when the ductus arteriosus fails to close during the early postnatal period (starting within hours of birth, complete by 2-3 weeks). In utero, the ductus arteriosus (DA) serves as a shunt between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, allowing fetal blood to bypass the high-pressure vascular system of the lungs, which are filled with fluid and not serving to oxygenate blood. \nShortly after birth, the lungs fill with air and the pressure within the pulmonary vasculature drops, reversing the shunt through the DA. The DA begins to close at this time, and eventually fibroses and becomes the ligamentum arteriosum, and there is no more shunt. \nIn some people, the DA does not close, so that a left-to-right shunt persists from the aorta to the pulmonary artery. The diameter and length of the PDA, and thus the amount of arterial blood being shunted to the lungs, determines whether or not the PDA causes symptoms or eventual complications.  In general, there are three categories (small, moderate, large) based on the pulmonary to systemic flow ratio of blood through the PDA.\nA small PDA may never be detected, because the amount of higher-pressure arterial blood being shunted to the pulmonary artery is not enough to cause pulmonary hypertension or exercise intolerance, as may be seen in larger shunts. The astute clinician may detect a continuous flow murmur during cardiac auscultation, but this is not always present. \nA moderate size PDA may cause exercise intolerance when lower extremity demand for oxygen is not met by left ventricular output, because some of the blood is being shunted back into the pulmonary circulation before it circulates systemically. The upper extremities may not be affected to the same degree, because the DA arises distal to the Left Subclavian Artery, and thus the upper extremities receive blood before it is shunted back into the pulmonary system. Also, as a result of this shunting, the left heart receives a larger volume of blood and, over time, this can result in left ventricular dilation and eventual dysfunction. These patients will likely have an audible flow murmur. \nA large PDA causes a significant shunt and overloading of the left ventricle because it must pump a larger amount of blood. This can result in dilation and LV failure. In addition, the higher systemic blood pressure is transmitted through the PDA to the normally-low pressure pulmonary vascular bed. Over time, this will result in pulmonary hypertension, which may become severe enough to overcome the systemic pressure and result in a reversal of the shunt (Eisenmenger Syndrome).  Now deoxygenated blood passes from the pulmonary artery through the PDA into the systemic circulation and mixes with arterial blood. This can cause cyanosis, which may be more pronounced in the lower extremities.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Discussion : Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder resulting in weakness of skeletal muscles, due to autoantibodies directed against acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular junctions.Clinical Features:Myasthenia presents in women between the ages of 20 \u2013 30, and in men over the age of sixty.  The symptoms worsen with exertion.  Cranial muscles are affected in 85% cases (lids, extraocular muscles, facial weakness, nasal or slurred speech, dysphagia).  These may be the only muscles affected, especially in the elderly.  As the disease becomes generalized, the limb muscles (often proximal and asymmetric) become involved.  Reflexes and sensation should be normal.  Primary complications are aspiration pneumonia (weak bulbar muscles) and respiratory failure (weak chest wall muscles).Pathophysiology:Specific anti-AchR antibodies reduce the number of AchRs at the NMJ.  With repeated muscle contraction, there is a decrease in the amount of acetylcholine released per impulse.  This results in pathologic fatigue.  The thymus is abnormal in 75% of patients with myasthenia (65% hyperplasia and 10% thymomas).  The reason for this compelling association remains unknown, but it is theorized that because the thymus contains a small number of myoid cells (which are distinguished by muscle striations and AcH receptors on their surface) along with the B-cells and T-cells, the thymus may play a role in myasthenia gravis by acting as an antigenic peptide sequence on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Evaluation:\nOther autoimmune disorders may also be associated with myasthenia gravis (thyroiditis, Graves\u2019 Disease, rheumatoid arthritis, SLE, and pure red cell aplasia) and should be evaluated for in the newly diagnosed patient with myasthenia.\n\nEvaluation:\n1.\tAchR antibodies \u2013 positive antibodies are diagnostic but not correlated with disease severity\n2.\tTensilon (edrophonium) test \u2013 short-acting anticholinesterase\n3.\tEMG \u2013 low frequency (2-4Hz) repetitive stimulation produces decreased amplitude\n4.\tChest CT/MRI \u2013 search for thymic abnormalities\n5.\tOther associated autoimmune disorders\n\nMedical Management:\n1.\tOcular only \u2013 pyridostigmine\n2.\tGeneralized \u2013 pyridostigmine, and immunosuppression (while steroids are the mainstay of treatment, the addition of cyclosporin may allow a decrease in the steroid dose)\n3.\tCrisis \u2013 Intensive care (intubate, fluids), plasmapheresis or IVIg\n\nSurgical Management:\n1.\tEvaluate for thymectomy (improves the likelihood of long-term remission in the adult).\n\nThe efficacy and use of thymectomy in the absence of thymoma is still controversial.  A review of literature shows that thymectomy was associated with disease remission and improvement with a rate of medication free remission of 2.1 and an improvement rate of 1.7.  However, there are other studies that reveal no statistical difference between thymectomy in the absence of thymoma and medical management only.  Still, for several reasons most neurologists and CT surgeons still recommend that total thymectomy be done.  First, you cannot tell the difference between thymic hyperplasia and thymic atrophy on imaging studies.  A residual thymus as in this case, may represent thymic hyperplasia with potential to become a thymoma or be simple residual tissue.   Also, if a thymoma is present there is always a chance of malignancy.  Lastly, because it is theorized that the thymus acts as an APC for auto-antibodies, it is widely believed that a total thymectomy will improve the likelihood of long-term remission.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Hydatid disease or Echinococcal cysts are caused by the parasite Echinococcus Granulosus or Echinococcus Multiloculoris.  These are carried by dogs, sheep and cattle.  The disease is rare in the United States, with only about 200 cases a year reported, mostly in the southwest and Alaska.  The disease is acquired as a child, with a latent period of 5 to 20 years  before signs or symptoms are noted.  The cysts continue to grow, eventually causing mechanical compression which leads to most symptoms.  Sixty percent of all these cysts are found in the liver, 25% in the lung, and 15% in the peritoneum, kidney, spleen, and retroperitoneum combined.  If the cysts of E. Granulosus rupture, they can cause an anaphylactoid reaction.  Theoretically, therefore, these masses should not be drained percutaneously.  In practice, however, some have been inadvertently punctured without complications.\n\nHydatid disease presents in four basic ultrasound patterns.  The first and most common is the cystic pattern, a round, anechoic, well-defined mass with smooth walls and posterior acoustic enhancement.  In 60% of cases, there is more than one parent cyst.  Some cysts may have septa dividing the cyst into numerous sections.  Occasionally the cysts may become infected.  With age, the cyst may collapse away from the edge of the cavity and may even fold in upon itself, forming what has been called the matrix.  This type of cyst cannot be differentiated from congenital cysts, traumatic cysts, or a cavitating tumor.  A second pattern, the racemose pattern,  has the parent cyst with daughter cysts (the pattern seen in this case).  The daughter cysts can be any number and appear round until they are so numerous that they become irregular and flat.  A third pattern consists of a solid mass that can be hypoechoic, hyperechoic, or isoechoic.  A fourth pattern presents with calcified walls.  Due to acoustic shadowing, a complete examination is often difficult.  However, by using different planes of section and varying the frequency and gain, the interior can usually be examined.  The interior is usually anechoic but may also be calcified.",

            "Diagnosis By": "Biopsy/pathology",
            "Discussion": "-Radiologic findings:\n  Plain radiography is the mainstay in the diagnosis of EG, although a specific diagnosis cannot always be made without bone biopsy because children and adolescents are not spared skeletal neoplasms. Radionuclide study; CT; MRI; and, occasionally, angiography are complementary examinations. Any or all may be used to arrive at a diagnosis.  The ribs show lytic expansile lesions, which may be associated with pathologic fractures.  Lesions are lytic, round or oval, and expansile, with ill-defined or sclerotic margins.  The medullary cavity may be expanded and associated with cortical thinning, intracortical tunneling, and erosion of the cortex and an adjacent soft-tissue mass.  Laminated periosteal new bone formation is common around the involved segment of bone.\n\t CT scans may be particularly useful in osseous lesions in areas with complex anatomy, such as the mastoids, atlantoaxial joints, and posterior elements of the vertebral bodies. Also, soft tissue components are better depicted on CT scans than on other images. The destruction of the mastoid, petrous ridge, tegmen tympani, and lateral sinus plate and the destruction of the inner and external ear are depicted elegantly on CT scans. CT may demonstrate an isoattenuating and homogeneously enhancing mass in the hypothalamus/pituitary gland.  CT is considerably better than plain radiography and conventional tomography in depicting an intracranial extension of EG.   CT appearances of EG are nonspecific, and a variety of inflammatory and neoplastic processes may mimic EG.\n\tOn spin-echo MRIs, osseous lesions of EG reveal decreased signal intensity on T1-weighted and high signal intensity on T2-weighted sequences. The lesion may enhance after the administration of a gadolinium-based contrast agent.  The value of using MRI to image patients with EG lies in the sensitivity of MRI because its specificity is low. However, the cost of the procedure and the procedural problems encountered in imaging young children confer no advantages over plain radiography.  The soft tissue component around the osseous lesion has poor definition and shows signal inhomogeneity, which may mimic that of a malignant tumor, infection, or stress fracture."

            "Title": "Eosinophilic granuloma",
            "Disease Discussion": "-Factoid Discussion:\n\n  The hallmark of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) in most patients is an osseous lesion.  When the bone is the only organ involved, the disease is referred to as eosinophilic granuloma.  EG is the benign form of the 3 clinical variants of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, which include Litterer-Siwe disease, Hand Schuller-Christian disease, and EG (formerly termed histiocytosis X).  When more organs are affected, causing cranial lesions, diabetes insipidus, and exophthalmos, it is refered to a Hand-Schuller-Christian disease.  The disseminated form of LCH, called Litterer-Siwe disease, is more often seen in infants and children who are less than 3 years old and is characterized by wasting, hepatosplenomegally, generalized lymphadenopathy, skin rash, generalized multiple lesions, and sometimes pancytopenia.\nEG is characterized by a single or multiple skeletal lesions, and it predominantly affects children, adolescents, or young adults.  Solitary lesions are more common that multiple lesions.  When multiple lesions occur, the new osseous lesions appear within 1-2 years.  Any bone and be involved, but the most common sites include the skull, mandible, spine, ribs, and long bones.\n\n-Etiology and Pathogenesis: \n\n  EG is a benign disorder that affects children and young adults, particularly males.  The solitary bone lesion may be asymptomatic, or it may cause bone pain because of expansion of the medullary bone.  Pathologic fractures may ensue. The pathogenesis of LCH is unknown.  An ongoing debate exists over whether this is a reactive or neoplastic process.  Arguments supporting the reactive nature of this disorder include the occurrence of spontaneous remissions, the failure to detect aneuploidy, metaphase or karyotypic abnormalities, and the good survival rate in patients without organ dysfunction. On the other hand, the infiltration of organs by aberrant cells, a possible lethal evolution, and the cancer-based modalities of successful treatment are all consistent with a neoplastic process. In addition, the demonstration of LCH as a monoclonal proliferation by X chromosome-linked DNA probes supports a neoplastic origin for this proliferation; however, the presence of this finding in distinct subtypes with different evolutions demands further investigations to evaluate its significance. \nThere is evidence for a role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of LCH by the creation of a permissive immunosurveillance system. Abnormalities of suppressor cell number and function have been documented in several reports. Increased levels of messenger RNA for macrophage colony stimulating factor and platelet derived growth factor have been detected in cells from a pulmonary LCH lesion.\n\n-Epidemiology:\n  LCH is a rare disease. Estimated annual incidence ranges from 0.5-5.4 per million persons per year. Approximately 1200 new cases per year are reported in the United States.   More than half of the patients younger than 2 years, with disseminated LCH and organ dysfunction die of the disease; whereas, unifocal LCH and the majority of cases of congenital self-healing histiocytosis, are self-limited. Multifocal chronic LCH is self-limited in most cases, though increased mortality has been observed among infants with pulmonary involvement.  Prevalence of LCH seems to be higher among whites.  Incidence of LCH is greater in males than in females (male-to-female ratio 2:1).   LCH affects patients from neonates to adults. Age of onset varies according to the variety of LCH. Letterer-Siwe disease occurs predominantly in children younger than 2 years. The chronic multifocal form, including the Hand-Schuller-Christian syndrome, has a peak of onset between 2-10 years of age. Localized eosinophilic granuloma occurs mostly frequently in those aged 5-15 years.\n\n-Clinical Manifestations:\n  Most patients have no symptoms, and the diagnosis is usually based on radiographic demonstration of a destructive bone lesion arising from the marrow cavity and on characteristic morphologic findings. Localized bone pain and focal tenderness may occur as a result of bone erosion and, rarely, a pathologic fracture. A swelling or mass may be palpable at the site of osseous involvement. Rarely, children may present with fever and leukocytosis. Involvement of the mastoid process involvement may appear with intractable otitis media with a chronic discharge. Mandibular involvement may present with gingival and continuous soft-tissue swelling.\n\n- Diagnosis:\n  Definite diagnosis is based on biopsy.  Because of the absence of distinctive morphologic characteristics of the LCH cell, special studies are used to identify the cell. The Birbeck granule is the distinctive ultrastructural hallmark of the LC. It consists of an intracytoplasmic membranous body, 33 nm wide and 190-360 nm long, possessing a short, rodlike shape with a dotted line down the midline of the space between the membranes (resembling a zipper) and a terminal expansion in the form of a vesicle giving a \"racquet\" appearance. Although these granules are resistant to destruction by formalin fixation and paraffin embedding, the sensitivity of detection in such specimens is slightly decreased. Birbeck granules are rarely detected in lesions of the liver, gastrointestinal tract, and spleen. Langerhans cells also contain laminated substructures of lysosomes, tuboreticular structures, and trilaminar membranous loops.  \nThe Writing Group of the Histiocyte Society (1987) has proposed 3 levels of certainty in the diagnosis of LCH based on the clinical features, histopathology, and special immunohistochemical techniques. A presumptive diagnosis is based on a typical clinical presentation and light microscopic findings. A designated diagnosis includes light microscopy in combination with positive S-100 and PNA staining studies. To make a definitive diagnosis, identification of Birbeck granules and CD1a antigens is required.\n\n-Treatment:\n  Solitary bone lesions are treated locally with curettage or excision.  Painful bone lesions may require intralesional steroid injection (triamcinolone acetonide).  Polyostotic bone lesions are best treated with indomethacin or a short course of systemic steroids.  Rarely, lesions that are unusually large and painful occur in inaccessible sites or involve vital structures. They require radiation (3-6 Gy [300-600 rads]).",

By placing the focal zone at or slightly below the area of interest, one is able to identify this characteristic rapidly fluctuating mixture of Doppler signals.  \n\nIn this particular case, the demonstration of the twinkle artifact is helpful because the non-obstructing renal calculi was diagnosed, sparing the patient further diagnostic tests or interventions. \n\nA few months later, the same patient underwent a abdominal CT which confirmed the presence of renal calculi."

White males with advancing age are frequently more affected, and in general males are three more times likely to develop renal stones than females.  \n\nThe most common type of renal stone is composed of either calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate (80 % - 85%).   Uric acid stones comprise about 5% to 10% of all renal calculi, and have been associated with gout, and Crohn\u2019s disease.  Struvite stones formed by urea-splitting bacteria such as Proteus, Pseudomonas, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella encompass about 10% of renal stones, and may develop into staghorn calculi.  Rarely, cistine stones may occur related to the metabolic disorder cistinuria.   \n\nSonographically: \n\t\nUltrasound has been described as having as high as 96% sensitivity for renal stone detection, with increasing sensitivity for larger calculi.  Sonographically, the appearance of a renal stone is dependent on the size of the stone, and not the chemical composition.  Large stones demonstrate an echogenic focus with an associated acoustic shadow.  Stones smaller than 5 mm may also appear as an echogenic focus, however, often lack an acoustic shadow creating difficulty in differentiating the stone from the echogenic renal sinus.  To further characterize small renal calculi, use of a high-frequency transducer may be of value.

            "Title": "Constrictive pericarditis, calcified pericardium",
            "Disease Discussion": "Elevated filling pressures in the presence of calcification of the pericardium is consistent with constrictive pericarditis.  Fibrous or calcific thickening of the pericardium may lead to constrictive pericardial disease due to restriction of cardiac motion which chronically compromises ventricular filling.  Onset of constrictive pericarditis is usually between the ages of 30-50 years and prevalence is three times greater in males than in females.  An associated protein losing enteropathy may be present.  The most common cause of constrictive pericardial disease is postpericardiotomy and hemopericardium for any reason.  The second most common cause is radiation therapy, but Coxsackie B virus, TB, uremia, connective tissue disease, neoplasm, and idiopathic etiologies may be seen.  \n\nPatients with constrictive pericarditis commonly present with symptoms of heart failure to include dyspnea, orthopnea, and fatigability.  They may occasionally present with liver enlargement, ascites and later on with cirrhosis (\"cardiac cirrhosis\")secondary to chronic hepatic congestion.\n\nNormal pericardial thickness is less than 2mm.  When greater than 4mm and accompanied by clinical findings of heart failure, constrictive pericarditis is highly likely.  It is essential to realize, however, that neither pericardial thickening nor calcification is pathognomonic of constrictive pericarditis unless the patient also has concomitant symptoms of physiologic constriction.  However, 50% of patients with pericardial calcifications have constrictive pericarditis.  Pericardial thickening may be global or limited to the right side of the heart or to the right AV groove.\n\nCalcifications are seen on plain film radiography in up to 50% of patients.  Ascites and plural effusions are common.  Normal to mild enlargement of the cardiac silhouette is commonly seen along with small atria, dilated superior and inferior vena cava and azygos vein, and flat or straitened right heart border.\n\nEchocardiography may show thickened pericardium, abnormal septal motion, and increased left ventricular ejection fraction with a small end-diastolic volume. \n\nCT and MR imaging are excellent in depicting the pericardium, and in aiding the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis, especially in difficult cases.  CT is particularly good for demonstrating pericardial thickening and calcification.  Reflux of contrast into the coronary sinus, a bowed interventricular septum, flattening of the right ventricle, ascites, and pleural effusions, may all be seen.  Both CT and MR show pericardial thickening, dilatation of the right atrium, inferior vena cava and hepatic veins along with a sigmoid septal shift (or prominent leftward septal convexity) and narrowing/reduced volume of the right ventricle.  MR may demonstrate abnormal flow mechanics in the vena cava and atria.\n\nFrom the clinical standpoint it is important to differentiate constrictive pericarditis from other restrictive myocardial diseases ( Myocarditis)since both entities have identical pathophysiologic findings on echocardiography or card cath. Myocarditis is difficult to treat and the only treatment is medical therapy. Constrictive pericarditis is treated surgically with pericardial stripping.",

They can arise in any part of the collecting system from a fornix to the renal pelvis. Size varies anywhere from a few millimeters to several centimeters in diameter. They are uroepithelial-lined cavities that communicate via a narrow channel to a nearby calyx. They may be congenital, or acquired lesions.\n\nIt is not uncommon to see calcified stones characteristically layering in the dependent portion of the diverticulum.  The stones that form within the diverticulum may pass and cause symptomatic renal colic but they are typically confined to the diverticulum due to its narrow neck connection to the distal collecting system.. \n\nThey are regions of urinary stasis and the dependent sediment that eventually develops in a calyceal diverticulum is referred to as \u201cmilk of calcium.\u201d Larger stones may form that are confined to the diverticulum and may be a source of chronic pain.\n\nOn CT, the diagnosis is made with delayed imaging showing the diverticulum fill with contrast. Alternatively if stones are present, the patient can be rescanned in the opposite position. If the stones settle dependently, and are confined to the lesion, the diagnosis can be made in the absence of delayed imaging.\n\nManagement of symptomatic stone disease associated with Calyceal diverticula has changed from an open surgical approach to include ESWL, percutaneous, laproscopic or ureteroscopic techniques. The choice of therapy depends largely on the anatomic location of the diverticulum.",

Although embryonal cell carcinomas have three sub-types: adult, infantile and endodermal sinus tumor, embryonal cell carcinomas tend to be less radio and chemosensitive than seminomatous tumors. Infantile and endodermal sinus types are associated with elevated alpha-fetoprotein which can be used to monitor therapy/recurrence. \nTeratomas are a second type of germ cell tumor.

            "Disease Discussion": "The spectrum of intracranial injuries in physically abused children includes:  acute subdural hematoma, chronic subdural hematoma, acute epidural hematoma, cerebral contusion, focal/multifocal/diffuse cerebral edema, and atrophy.  Acute and/or chronic subdural hematomas and cerebral contusion are common in child abuse.  Intracerebral hematomas and epidural hematomas are uncommon.\n\nUntreated acute subdural hematomas undergo a series of predictable pathologic changes.  Soon after the acute hemorrhage, the blood collection becomes surrounded by endothelial cells and there is invasion by granulation tissue.  Progressive liquefaction of the hematoma results in its conversion to a serous fluid.  These serous subdural collections are referred to as chronic subdural hematomas or subdural hygromas.  Chronic subdural hematomas, related to prior trauma, are most often located adjacent to one or both cerebral convexities but may also extend into the interhemispheric fissure.\n\nThe CT appearance of a subdural hematoma varies according to the time period since the injury.  The initial hemorrhage is visualized as a high-attenuation fluid collection on CT.  The attenuation values of the lesion progressively decrease over the next weeks to months.  Chronic subdural hematomas usually contain serous fluid and produce attenuation values slightly greater than those of CSF.  It is not uncommon for an abused child to have suffered multiple episodes of trauma, resulting in intracranial hematomas in different stages of evolution.\n\nAt times, chronic subdural hematomas are difficult to differentiate from enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces.  In many cases, a distinct transition is visible between the subdural fluid collection and the slightly lower attenuation CSF of the subarachnoid space.  A membrane of variable thickness separating the two spaces may be identifiable.  The brain adjacent to a chronic subdural hematoma is often displaced, and the sulci may be compressed and effaced.  In contradistinction, enlarged subarachnoid spaces are associated with interdigitation of the fluid into the cerebral sulci.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of isolated chronic subdural fluid collections in infants includes bacterial meningitis, remote trauma, rickets, and Menke's syndrome.  In the absence of a clear-cut, suitable clinical history of other forms of trauma, the CT demonstration of coexistent acute and chronic subdural hematomas is highly suggestive of child abuse.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Crohn\u2019s disease, (aka \u201cgranulomatous\u201d colitis, regional enteritis, granulomatous ileitis) is a transmural inflammatory bowel disease of unknown etiology, affecting the terminal ileum in the vast majority of affected patients.  Skip lesions may also occur, with eventual involvement of the colon in 70%. Initial presentation is in the teens or early twenties, with males and females equally affected. Onset may be insidious, with initial symptoms ranging from mild diarrhea and low grade fever, to more acute symptoms resembling appendicitis. The earliest macroscopic manifestation is apthoid ulceration of the gut mucosa with eventual enlargement of the ulcers and confluence thereof. Microscopically small granulomas resembling sarcoid granulomas are found, containing multinucleated giant cells of Langhans\u2019 type. Interestingly, such granulomas are more frequently found in the lymph nodes draining the diseased segment, and less so in the segment itself.  Ultimate complete loss of mucosa, fibrosis and narrowing of the lumen is a common outcome. Associated inflammation leads to mass effect displacing or effacing structures in the right lower quadrant. Due to the transmural ulceration fistulization between adjacent loops of small bowel and the colon may be seen, as well as fistulization between the bladder, vagina, ureter, and skin.  The proximal small bowel, stomach, and esophagus may also be affected, in that decreasing order of frequency. Such proximal involvement, however, rarely occurs independent of terminal ileal involvement. \n\n\nPrevious studies of nuclear medicine inflammatory bowel imaging demonstrate good correlation between locale of uptake on In-111/WBC scanning and region of bowel affected, however Tc-99m HMPAO/WBC scanning has been shown to demonstrate better localization properties. Additionally, Tc-99m provides a lesser radiation dose to the spleen by virtue of its shorter half life (6hrs vs 67 hrs); thus it is preferred in the pediatric population. Finally, Tc-99mHMPAO/WBC results may be obtained as rapidly as within one hour after injection of the radiopharmaceutical. Should In-111/WBC scanning be done, however, initial imaging should be done at 4 hours rather than the typical 24 hour delay.

            "Title": "Solitary Pulmonary Nodule - Calcified Granuloma",
            "Disease Discussion": "One of the most common tasks in the daily life of a radiologist is assessing new solitary pulmonary nodules. By definition, a solitary pulmonary nodule is an opacity, 3 cm or less in diameter, without associated mediastinal lymphadenopathy or atelectasis. Lesions larger than 3 cm in diameter usually are defined as masses.   Most of these represent bronchogenic carcinomas. But even a smaller nodular opacity may represent a relatively early and potentially curable primary bronchogenic carcinoma. The task of the radiologist is to distinguish such a lesion from common benign causes of a pulmonary nodule, especially a granuloma or hamartoma. Proper evaluation is important so that expeditious surgical removal of a potentially curable bronchogenic carcinoma can be accomplished, while concomitantly avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for the benign conditions. In some surgical series, <50% of resected nodules are due to a malignant neoplasm. \nThe initial evaluation of the suspicious nodule should begin with a comparison of any obtainable previous chest radiographs. Absence of growth for two years generally is indicative of a benign lesion. \n\nLesion calcium and contour are important clues to the nature of a solitary pulmonary nodule.  Calcium is easy to recognize when it is deposited in a distinctive pattern\u2014such as a central nidus, in concentric rings, or in a popcorn-like configuration\u2014because of the contrast difference with noncalcified areas of the nodule. But it is much more difficult to ascertain when the calcium is distributed diffusely throughout the lesion in a homogeneous fashion. Since density on a radiographic film is an imprecise parameter, the determination of the calcium content of a nodule that appears homogeneous on standard radiography is often quite subjective. \n\nIn most situations when the plain chest radiograph demonstrates a suspicious nodule, CT should be used because it is the most effective, objective, and widely available radiologic technique to further assess the nature (shape, borders, and density) of a presumed solitary pulmonary nodule. Furthermore, simultaneous assessment of the mediastinum and chest wall is achieved, along with comprehensive evaluation of both lungs. Not infrequently, other pulmonary nodules are detected in the patient suspected to have a single lesion on chest radiography. The alternatives generally available besides CT are surgical resection via thoracotomy or thoracoscopic wedge resection, needle biopsy, or the much less desirable approach of obtaining frequent serial radiographs to monitor possible growth of the lesion.\n\nThe basic assumption underlying the use of CT densitometry is that the presence of calcification in a well-circumscribed pulmonary nodule is a strong indicator of a benign lesion because granulomas contain greater amounts of calcium much more frequently than malignant neoplasms. Obviously, CT would not be warranted in an attempt to distinguish a benign granuloma from a metastasis in a patient who has had a primary osseous or soft-tissue sarcoma (e.g., osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma) or a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma (e.g., colon, ovary, or breast) that might calcify. Also, metastases that have a propensity to bleed (e.g., choriocarcinoma or melanoma) may have higher CT numbers than soft tissue because of fresh hemorrhage or calcification induced by prior bleeding, but such lesions almost always have irregular margins. \nOccasionally, other features are detected that permit confident diagnosis of a benign lesion, such as lucent areas of fat within the nodule consistent with a hamartoma. Adjacent small satellite nodules suggest a benign etiology, most typically granulomatous infection. Lesions that are not truly nodular on CT, but rather linear or ovoid, also are usually benign. \n\nWhile there are no pathognomonic radiologic features of a malignant pulmonary lesion, thin section CT may strongly suggest that a small peripheral nodule represents a primary lung carcinoma. An outer margin that has a spiculated interface with lung or is hazy and less dense than centrally due to lepidic growth favors a malignant neoplasm. An endobronchial component, convergence with a peripheral pulmonary vein, or focal pleural retraction toward the lesion are additional signs suggesting a malignant lesion. A heterogeneous internal composition, especially with small areas of necrosis, supports the diagnosis of a carcinoma. Small air bronchograms, or focal bubble lucencies (air bronchiolograms), in a poorly marginated pulmonary nodule are more common in a malignant lesion, especially bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, and sometimes lymphoma; however, these findings may also occur in benign inflammatory masses. If the lesion is probably malignant, a subsequent or preceding standard post-contrast-enhanced CT examination of the thorax and upper abdomen should be obtained for comprehensive staging, including a search for additional lung lesions.\n \nThe margins of the lesion must be relatively smooth in order to confidently diagnose a benign lesion, since a small percentage of primary bronchogenic carcinomas may contain foci of dystrophic calcification. Such calcification, usually eccentric and stippled, is most typically found in larger lesions that almost always have markedly irregular margins. Relatively large and central carcinoid tumors also may contain foci of calcification; a clue to the proper etiology is their central location immediately adjacent to a secondary bronchus. Most calcified granulomas are in the periphery of the lung. Hamartomas, which also may be peripherally located, can contain calcification. It is sometimes characteristically popcorn or chondroid-like, and at times may be detected in conjunction with fat in the lesion.\n\nBecause thinly collimated scans are noisier and subject to greater statistical variation and it is known that malignant neoplasms may contain calcification, it is generally judicious to obtain follow-up chest radiographic study in 3 to 6 months to corroborate that the calcified nodule depicted on CT has a stable growth pattern. \n\nThe presence or absence of enhancement after intravenous contrast administration may contribute further data in predicting the etiology of a well-circumscribed homogeneous nodule that remains indeterminate.  Similarly, FDG PET imaging, which assesses metabolic activity, may have equivalent or superior efficacy in separating a benign from a malignant nodule.",

If the tumor is invasive, anatomic staging with CT or MR and sometimes US is indicated.  The most common staging sytem used is the TNM classification.

            "Title": "Ovarian Torsion",
            "Disease Discussion": "Ovarian torsion results from rotation of the ovary (with or without the fallopian tube) on its axis resulting in arterial, venous and lymphatic congestion. Pathologically enlarged ovaries from cysts, tumors or paraovarian cysts are at risk for torsion.  The most common ovarian neoplasm involved is the benign cystic teratoma. Ovarian torsion may also occur in a normal ovary with a hypermobile adnexa, which may be seen in prepubertal girls and pregnancy, or an excessively long mesosalpinx. Ovarian torsion usually affects young women and more commonly prepubertal girls.  There is also an increased risk during pregnancy. \n\nThe patient presentation may be nonspecific and therefore the patients may undergo extensive evaluation before establishing a diagnosis. Patients typically present with sudden onset or gradual severe lower abdominal or pelvic pain with or without nausea, vomiting and fever. Approximately half of patients with ovarian torsion will have a palpable mass. Initially the torsed ovary undergoes venous stasis and if prolonged, congestion and edema progress with arterial stasis resulting in hemorrhagic necrosis and gangrene. Torsion involves the right ovary more than the left and this is thought due to a potential protective effect of the sigmoid mesentery. \n\nRadiologic evaluation of patients with ovarian torsion is optimally performed with ultrasound but often these patients undergo other imaging modalities due to their nonspecific presentation. Ultrasound findings include a markedly enlarged hypo or hyperechoic midline mass with multiple peripheral cysts/follicles measuring 8-12 mm in diameter. There is often good sound transmission due to edema from vascular engorgement. Cul-de-sac free pelvic fluid may be seen in approximately one third. Absence of ovarian arterial and venous Doppler waveforms is helpful to establish the diagnosis but not always reliable due to the dual blood supply by the uterine and ovarian arteries. Also helpful but not always visible is the \u201cwhirlpool\u201d sign from the twisted ovarian pedicle. A complex mass may be identified if there is a cyst or tumor as a lead point.  \n\nComputed tomography may be performed as the initial imaging modality. Findings of ovarian torsion on CT include a large adenxal or ovarian mass with smooth wall thickening and no enhancing solid component. Peripherally located follicles may or may not be visible. Other associated findings include thickening of the involved fallopian tube or visualizing the torsed vascular pedicle as a whorled structure adjacent to the ovarian mass. Attenuation greater than 50 on a nonenhanced CT suggests hemorrhagic infarction.\n\nTreatment is immediate surgery. However, most ovaries are not salvageable.",

IPMN is classified into three types: branch pancreatic duct type, main pancreatic duct type, and combined type.  Combined type is the most common.\n\nIPMN presents clinically with diarrhea, pain, weight loss, acute pancreatitis and diabetes.  Typical age of onset is 60-80 y/o, more commonly in males.\n\nCT findings for branch pancreatic duct type include a thin, irregular and peripheral lobulated multicystic lesion (\u201cgrape-like\u201d clusters).The main pancreatic duct type appears as a markedly dilated and tortuous main pancreatic duct.  Polypoid lesions may be seen lining the main duct.  The combined type appears as a multicystic lesion (commonly within the uncinate process) which is contiguous with a markedly dilated and tortuous main pancreatic duct. MRCP will show communication between the dilated duct and cystic lesions.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for IPMN includes chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, mucinous cystic neoplasm and serous cystadenoma.  This patient had no history of pancreatitis.  \n\nImaging features of IPMN with invasive carcinoma may include mural nodularity or solid mass measuring 3-10 mm, diffuse or multifocal main duct involvement, main or combined duct types, main pancreatic duct measuring > 10-15 mm, branch duct type measuring > 3 cm or mural nodularity, common bile duct > 15 mm, or evidence of metastases.  Generally, main duct and combined duct types are resected in good surgical candidates.  Branch duct type IPMN without suggestion of invasive carcinoma may be monitored.  Although all IPMNs are felt to have malignant potential.\n\nReferences:\n\nLim JH, et al. Radiologic spectrum of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas.

            "Disease Discussion": "Many of the findings of colonic inflammation are fairly characteristic of the specific type of colitis that is present.  CT findings used to differentiate one form of colitis from another include:\n\nDegree of mural thickening\nExtent to which the layers of the thickened colonic wall are visible\nPresence of fistulae or abscesses\nAnatomic distribution of the CT abnormalities in the large and small intestine\n\n \nUlcerative colitis involves the rectum in virtually all patients. It extends proximally in one continuous segment to involve the remainder of the colon to a variable extent. Computed tomography shows mild-to-moderate, concentric, mural thickening.  The mucosa, the low-density, thickened submucosa, and the serosa are usually visible as three distinct layers. These abnormalities sometimes give the rectum a target-like appearance.  In most patients, there is loss of the normal haustral contour and the colon is shortened. Fistulae and pericolonic abscesses are rare. Proliferation of the perirectal fat is also commonly seen.\n\nIn patients with Crohn disease (granulomatous colitis), the entire colon and distal small bowel may be involved; the most common sites are the terminal ileum, right colon, and rectum. Normal intervening segments, so-called skip areas, often separate affected segments of bowel. The colonic wall tends to be thicker than in patients with ulcerative colitis.  The layers of the affected bowel wall may be similar in CT attenuation, giving the wall a homogeneous appearance, but this is not always the case.  Typically, there is inflammation of the pericolonic fat, which appears as a diffuse, hazy increase in its CT attenuation, reflecting the transmural nature of this disease.  As in patients with ulcerative colitis, carcinoma can occasionally develop. In this setting, adenocarcinoma is sometimes scirrhous in type and its CT appearance can mimic that of a benign inflammatory stricture.  Fistulae are common in patients with granulomatous colitis, particularly in the perirectal area.  Abdominal abscesses also may develop adjacent to severely affected segments of bowel.\n\nPseudomembranous colitis is caused by toxins produced by Clostridium difficile, a gram-positive bacterium that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract in some patients receiving antibiotic therapy.  CT shows characteristic marked thickening of the colonic wall and interhaustral folds, which are sometimes so severe as to nearly obliterate the colonic lumen.  The entire colon is usually involved, but involvement confined to the right colon is not unusual.  Strand-like pattern of edema in the pericolonic fat is present in nearly half of cases.  Fifteen percent of patients have ascites.\n\nCytomegalovirus colitis is seen in the setting of an immunocompromised patient.  Findings mimic those of C. difficile disease, with profound thickening of the colonic wall and haustra and pericolonic edema.  In both conditions, the mural thickening is largely the result of an edematous submucosal layer that has a low CT attenuation value. \n\nDisseminated histoplasmosis is being seen with increasing frequency because of the susceptibility of patients with AIDS to this disease, especially in endemic areas.  Colonic lesions often have an \u201capple-core\u201d appearance on barium enema, which appear on CT as one or more focal areas of mural thickening with adjacent adenopathy of mixed attenuation.  Usually, tissue diagnosis is required to separate these lesions from adenocarcinoma.\n\nColitis due to Schistosoma japonicum presents as left colon mild mural thickening with obliteration of the normal haustral pattern.  Frequently, there is a peculiar pattern of curvilinear calcification in the colonic wall.  Since dense radioopaque contrast can obscure these calcifications, water should be considered as a colonic contrast agent when schistosomiasis is considered a possible etiology. \n\nBeh?et disease most commonly involves the ileocecal region and ascending, but abnormalities may occur anywhere in the colon.  Marked focal thickening of the colonic wall surrounds isolated large cecal ulcers.  This appearance may easily be confused with the ileocecal mural thickening of tuberculosis, which may be distinguished based on associated with low-density caseating lymph nodes in the mesentery.  In the setting of neutropenia, typhlitis may present with low-attenuation cecal mural thickening, with or without mural gas.\n\nFinally, a noninflammatory etiology that must be considered is ischemia.  This classically involves the descending colon and may involve the spenic flexure and sigmoid region.  Expect to see a segmental area of mural thickening which may be severe enough to narrow the lumen.",

            "Treatment & Follow Up": "Due to the spleen\u2019s key immunologic function in the fighting of infections with encapsulated organisms, splenectomy is a last resort with conservative therapy currently advocated.  As a result, arteriography with the option of embolization therapy is indicated after lacerations are evident on CT imaging of hemodynamically stable patient.  The goal of embolization is essentially to reduce the main arterial pressure head via the placement of coils proximally within the splenic artery.  Infarctions are thus prevented due to sufficient blood flow around the occlusive coils via collateral areteries already present.",
            "Discussion": "The spleen is the most frequently injured abdominal organ in blunt trauma accounting for approximately a quarter of all blunt injuries to the abdominal viscera.  Although peritoneal lavage can be diagnostic, CT has superceded its usage; although, some studies have demonstrated that this modality can underestimate the degree of splenic injury.  CT classification of splenic injuries has been proposed as follows:\n\nClass I   Capsular disruption and/or subcapsular hematoma without significant parenchymal injury.\n\nClass II  Single or multiple capsular and parenchymal defects that do not extend into the hilum or involve major vessels.\n\nClass III  Deep lacerations extending into the hilum and involving major vessels.\n\nClass IV Shattered spleen.\n\nAlthough only 30 to 40% of patients present with hypotension, hemodynamic instability can be a presenting symptom that requires immediate intervention.  Abdominal pain often localized to the left upper quadrant can be present.  Left shoulder pain also known as Kehr\u2019s sign may be exhibited upon supine or Trendelenburg positioning.  Balance\u2019s sign represents free peritoneal fluid with dullness to percussion overlying the paracolic gutters, which disappears with positional changes."

It is known to be caused by over 200 conditions with asbestos, radiation, aspiration pneumonia, connective tissue disease, chemotherapy drugs, and amyloidosis being some of the most common causes.  Interstitial lung disease is believed to result from inflammation and secondary fibrosis.  Patients often present with progressive exertional dyspnea or non productive cough.  Hemoptysis, chest pain, and wheezing may also be present.   Dermatomyositis is an inflammatory myopathy that results in interstitial lung disease in approximately 10% of patients with the disease.  It causes skeletal muscle weakness, affects both children and adults, and tends to affect women more than men.  A characteristic rash often accompanies or more often precedes the disease helping differentiate it clinically from polymyositis.  The rash is often heliotrope (blue-purple discoloration) and tends to affect the upper eyelids with associated edema.  A flat red rash on the face and upper trunk, as well as erythema of the knuckles with raised violaceous scaly eruption (Gottron Rash) may also be present.  Diagnosis is confirmed by examining serum muscle enzymes, EMG findings, and muscle biopsy.  Treatment options include high dose prednisone 1mg/kg, azathioprine or methotrexate, or IVIG.  This patient's PA/Lateral CXR shows diffuse bilateral reticular and nodular opacities consistent with interstitial lung disease.

            "Disease Discussion": "Osteoid osteoma is a benign osteoid nidus with a center that may be radiographically sclerotic or lucent, and a surrounding zone of reactive bone formation.  The lesion is typically subcentimeter, unifocal, and causes pain that is worst at night and relieved within 20-25 minutes of taking aspirin.  It can occur virtually anywhere in the skeleton, but most commonly appears in the femoral neck, tibial midshaft, and diaphysis of other long bones. Rarely, osteoid osteomas occur in the bones of the face.    Patients are usually between 10 and 35 years old.\n\nConventional radiography and CT imaging typically reveal a benign-appearing, cortical, medullary, or subperiosteal radiolucency surrounded by a well-defined zone of sclerosis.  Often, a radiodense nidus is seen centrally.  90% of osteoid osteomas show intense focal uptake on bone scan.  CT is becoming the diagnostic modality of choice, as its capacity for excellent bony detail easily demonstrates the characteristic sclerotic nidus within the sclerotic-rimmed lucency, and allows precise location of the lesion.  MRI may define a nidus that remains unapparent on CT or scintigraphy, but is not generally employed.\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes stress fracture, cortical abcess, and intracortical osteosarcoma in cortical lesions; Brodie's abcess, bone island, and osteoblastoma in medullary lesions.  The characteristic appearance of osteoid osteoma often is enough to confirm the diagnosis.  Osteoid osteomas lack the lucent lines of stress fractures, the lucent tracts of abcesses, the bulging cortical disruptions of osteosarcoma, the periosteal reaction of osteoblastoma, and the normal bone scan and \u201cbrush\u201d trabecular borders of bone islands.  Intense focal uptake on bone scan may confirm the diagnosis.  \n\nThese lesions are treated by either curettage or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, often with CT or gamma camera guidance.  Anything less than total resection or ablation of the central nidus risks a high rate of recurrence.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Ameloblastoma is a benign neoplasm originating from odontogenic epithelium and represent approximately 10% of odontogenic tumors. They occur predominantly in the 3rd through 5th decades of life, but are seen in a wide age range of patients and demonstrate no gender or racial predilection. Most ameloblastomas occur in the ramus and posterior body of the mandible (80% of cases) and patients usually present with a slow-growing, painless mass. Although usually considered benign, ameloblastoma can demonstrate locally aggressive behavior.\n\nAmeloblastoma is typically expansile with an osseous shell that represents the involved bone. They can perforate the lingual cortex of the mandible and extend into the adjacent soft tissues. Ameloblastomas can vary in radiographic appearance. Some appear as well-defined, unilocular, well-corticated, lucent lesions that are often associated with the crowns of impacted or unerupted teeth.  \n\nAs a result, a unilocular ameloblastoma  may be radiographically indistinguishable from odontogenic keratocysts and dentigerous cysts. Other ameloblastomas are multilocular with internal septa and a honeycomb or soap bubble appearance and are often similar in appearance to large odontogenic keratocysts. Definitively diagnosis is by histological evaluation. \n\nTreatment of ameloblastoma depends on the extent of tumor infiltration through the cyst wall and into surrounding bone. Excision of a relatively contained ameloblastoma could involve localized removal of the lesion with wide margins; if the lesion is highly infiltrative and extensive, en bloc resection would be performed. Recurrent ameloblastomas may be more widespread and destructive than the original lesion. \n\n\nPMID: 17102048\nPMID: 10489168",

            "Disease Discussion": "Osteopoikilosis originally described by Albers-Schonberg and Ledoux-Lebard in the early 20th century is an asymptomatic osteosclerotic dysplasia.   Seen in both men and women, it is not typically seen in patients younger than three years old, and may be more common than previously thought.  Osteopoikilosis displays an autosomal dominant mode of transmission.\n\nClinical manifestations are absent or mild. In approximately 25% of cases, osteopoikilosis is associated with a specific syndrome such as mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia (coexistence of two or more of melorheostosis, osteopoikilosis, and osteopathia striata), Buschke-Ollendorf syndrome (osteopoikilosis and connective tissue nevi -dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata), and Gunal-Seber-Basaran syndrome (osteopoikilosis and dacrocystitis).  Additionally, dwarfism, dystocia, and spinal stenosis are other associations.\n\nRadiographic findings are diagnostic.  Numerous, small, well-defined, homogeneous ovoid or circular foci of increased density are clustered in a symmetric distribution in the epiphyses of long bones in a periarticular distribution or throughout smaller bones, such as the carpal and tarsal bones.  The sclerotic foci can also occur throughout the pelvis and vertebrae, and may increase in size with age until skeletal maturity is reached.  Complete disappearance of sclerotic foci has been observed.\n\nDifferential considerations include osteoblastic metastases, mastocytosis, and tuberous sclerosis.  The symmetric distribution, the predilection for the epiphyses and metaphyses, and the uniform size of the sclerotic foci suggest osteopoikilosis. Bone scintigraphy is useful in differentiating osteopoikilosis from bony metastases, as sclerotic foci of osteopoikilosis do not accumulate radiotracer in bone scans, unlike osteoblastic metastasis.  Positive bone scans are possible in children, and occur rarely in adults.\n\nHistologically, each sclerotic lesion represents a focus of lamellar bone containing haversian systems, and is identical to enostosis.",

In fact, until the 2002 article cited below, benign deposition of fat within the esophagus had never been decribed in the American radiology literature - rather only in European radiology literature. \n\nThe appearance is known as the \"double ring esophageal sign.\" The double ring consists of a low-attenuation ring between two higher-density bands. The low attenuation ring shows negative Hounsfield unit measurements as with subcutaneous fat. The fat ring is smooth and ranges in thickness from 1 mm to 3 mm. \n\nThis typical CT feature is consistent with esophageal lipomatosis and should be differentiated from other fatty lesions of the esophagus , e.g, lipoma and liposarcoma. Lipomas and liposarcomas are masses often surrounded by a single ring of the normal esophageal wall. Esophageal lipomatosis, on the other hand, has the double ring previously described - and that can be seen in the associated images in this case.\n\nA potential etiology of esophageal lipomatosis includes steroid use, which is known to induce atrophy or fatty infiltration of striated muscles. Esophageal lipomatosis is most often seen in the proximal esophagus, where striated muscle predominates in the esophagus.\n\nIncidence is difficult to accurately measure, but the article below found esophageal lipomatosis present in 7 of 1555 CT exams reviewed - equal to 0.45%.\n\nPMID: 12218824\nPMID: 10997425",

A discrete infolding of the posterolateral wall of the aorta in the region of the ligamentum or ductus is typically noted. This abnormality can occur in either the preductal or postductal location which modulates the age and severity of presentation.\n\nCoarctation proximal to the ductus presents shortly after birth and is usually associated with hypoplasia of the arch between the left subclavian artery and the ductus (2). The preductal location limits the blood volume load needed for normal aortic development.\n\nPostductal coarctation is more common than the preductal form and often is not symptomatic in the neonatal period.\n\nTypically, there is dilatation of the descending aorta distal to the coarctation with collateralization of vessels into the aorta primarilly via the intercostal arteries (2). This finding can result in rib notching. An abberant right subclavian artery that originates distal to the coarctation can serve as a major collateral to the right and rib notching occurs only on the left. If the left subclavian artery arises distal to the coarctation, then the rib notching is unilateral on the right (3).\n\n\nBalloon Angioplasty - http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1767490",

It is generally treated with chemotherapy, with or without radiation treatment.  Non small cell is diagnosed in approximately 75% or patients with lung cancer.  Majority of NSCLC are not surgically respectable at the time of diagnosis.  Adenocarcinoma most often arises as a peripheral lung nodule.  Small cell and squamous are mostly central in location. \n \nFor NSCLC, approximately 12-20% are asymptomatic at the time of diagnosis.  Peripheral tumors are clinically silent for a longer period and are more likely to be discovered incidentally on a routine chest radiograph.  Symptoms include cough, wheezing, hemoptysis, recurrent pneumonia, and paraneoplastic syndromes.  Invasion often causes hoarseness, chest wall pain, brachial plexus neuropathy, Horner\u2019s syndrome, phrenic nerve paralysis, superior vena caval obstruction, dysphagia, plural effusion, or pericardial tamponade. Hilar and mediastinal node involvement and distant metastases to the brain and adrenal glands are frequent at or after initial presentation.  \n\nStaging for non-small cell is largely based on the TNM system. The most frequently used imaging modalities are plain chest radiograph and CT.  Staging of the tumor influences the management options and prognosis.",

Clinically patients have painless proptosis. The definition of proptosis is protrusion of the globe more than 21 mm beyond the interzygomatic line at the level of the mid lens. Eighty-five percent of patients have bilateral involvement, 5% unilateral.  The most common pattern is enlargement of all the muscles most profoundly the inferior and medial rectus muscles (especially apparent on coronal images). If the lateral rectus is the only muscle enlarged an alternative diagnosis should be considered. Unlike orbital pseudotumor, a granulomatous disease of unknown etiology (but may be related to sarcoidosis), there is not involvement of the muscular insertions on the globes in thyroid ophthalmopathy. \n\tWhile 90% of patients experience complete resolution of symptoms over several months, 5-10% can develop optic neuropathy due to ischemia to the optic nerve at the orbital apex.

These tumors arise from mesenchymal cells rather than epithelial cells and range from benign to malignant.\n\nTypically, patients range in age from 45-65 years of age and there is no association with asbestos exposure. Histologically the tumor is composed of spindle shaped cells interspersed within a collagen matrix. Grossly the lesions appear as pleural based masses. Occasionally they may be surrounded entirely by lung. Seventy five percent arise from the visceral pleura while the remaining twenty five percent arise from the parietal pleura. The mass is pedunclated in fifty percent of the tumors; this form has the greatest association with benignity. Histologically malignant tumors often invade the chest wall and mediastinum.\n\nClinically the patients are usually asymptomatic and the tumors are found as an incidental finding. The tumors are slow growing and, when symptomatic, the patient presents with cough, pleuritic chest pain, and dyspnea. Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy is seen in 4%-12% of the cases and is more common in larger tumors (> 7cm). Episodic hypoglycemia is reported in up to 6% of patients.\n\nChest radiographs demonstrate an ovoid homogenous mass in contact with the pleural surface which may invaginate or arise from a fissure. Tumors range is size from 1 to 30 cm. The pleural origin of the mass may be difficult to determine in extremely large masses. The angle of the mass with the chest wall may be obtuse or acute, and peduculated lesions may change position within the chest on subsequent images (and with stages of respiration). Malignant tumors can invade the chest wall and cause destruction of bone. \n\nCT images usually will show well marginated pleural based lesions growing outward from a narrow base forming acute angles with the chest wall (75% of cases). Small tumors show soft tissue attenuation and larger lesions may demonstrate central necrosis. The mass shows homogenous enhancement. Again, lesions may appear to arise from fissures and pedunculated lesions may appear mobile. Pleural effusions are rare and calcification has been reported to occur in 10% of cases.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Angiomyolipoma (AML) is the most common benign renal tumor composed of blood vessels, smooth muscle, and adipose tissue.  AML is identified most frequently in middle-aged women, and may be seen in patients diagnosed with tuberous sclerosis.  In patients without tuberous sclerosis, AML is most often unilateral in location, whereas patients with tuberous sclerosis frequently demonstrate multiple, small, bilateral AMLs.\n\nPatients with AML smaller than 4 cm are generally asymptomatic.  If an AML is found to be larger than 4 cm, the presenting signs or symptoms are typically hematuria and or flank pain, and the tumor is resected secondary to an increased risk of hemorrhage.  Additionally, if the tumor size is 1 cm or larger, thin section CT should be performed to evaluate for the presence of fat.  If fat is not identified on CT, then the diagnosis of Renal Cell Carcinoma should be entertained.  Small, asymptomatic AMLs should be followed for evidence of growth.\n\n\n\u2022  Ultrasound \n\nAngiomyolipoma (AML) may have a varied acoustic pattern as the amount of adipose tissue, smooth muscle, and blood vessels vary from lesion to lesion.  Generally, AML is a homogenous well defined hyperechoic cortical neoplasm arising from the renal parenchyma, with echogenecity similar to that of the renal sinus.  Occasionally, AML may appear as a hypoechoic focus when smooth muscle, blood vessels, or hemorrhage constitute the majority of the lesion.  Color flow Doppler imaging is helpful in cases of hemorrhagic AML. \n\nRenal Cell Carcinoma (RCC) may also appear hyperechoic on ultrasound.  To distinguish a RCC from an AML, the presence of a peripheral hypoechoic rim surrounding an echogenic solid lesion, as well as demonstrable cystic elements strongly suggests a RCC.  Additionally, RCC typically lacks an acoustic shadow, whereas 20%-30% of AMLs have a varied degree of posterior shadowing.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Colloid cysts are uncommon benign cysts of the anterior superior third ventricle, which are thought to arise from embryologic tissues of the paraphysis, ependyma, or choroid plexus. These lesions typically present in young adults in the 2nd to 5th decade with complaints referable to acute or chronic hydrocephalus. Other symptoms include ataxia, memory disturbances, and gait disorders. The cyst contents include secretory and breakdown products of the epithelial lining tissue, including hemorrhage, lipid (cholesterol), hemosiderin, and CSF. \n\nOn T1-weighted MR images, these cysts vary widely from hypo- to hyperintense in comparison to normal brain. Although they may be bright on T2-weighted images, moderate to marked hypointensity is common and has been attributed to a very short T1 relaxation time or to magnetic susceptibility effect from paramagnetic substances in the cyst. On noncontrast MR, these lesions occasionally are indistinguishable by intensity from neoplasia; however, the absence of enhancement, classic location, and relative hypointensity on T2-weighted studies should suggest this diagnosis. Treatment is variable, including ventricular shunting alone, stereotactic cyst drainage, or surgical resection. \n\nOn noncontrast CT, colloid cysts are solitary, round to oval, usually hyperdense masses at the foramen of Monro with associated enlargement of one or both lateral ventricles (Film .3). Minimal or absent contrast enhancement is typical. Moderate enhancement with contrast suggests a different etiology, such as glioma, craniopharyngioma, choroid plexus papilloma, or remotely meningioma. Other cystic masses such as arachnoid or ependymal cysts will mimic CSF in density and intensity.\n\nVideo - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NbKjXChneo&",

Patient presentation includes severe chest pain after straining in up to 95% of cases and hematemesis in up to 30%.  It occurs 5 times more commonly in males.  Chest X-ray classically shows pneumomediastinum and pleural effusion.  The effusion tends to be greater on the left. Chest radiographs are said to be abnormal in up to 90% of cases of esophageal perforation although abnormalities \nmay be non-specific and may not be evident immediately after the perforation occurs. Other radiographic findings that may result from esophageal perforation include subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal air-fluid levels, mediastinal widening, pneumothorax, hydrothorax, or pulmonary infiltrates. CT allows more sensitive evaluation for mediastinal fluid and air in addition to pleural effusion.  Radiographic \ncontrast study of the esophagus may show the site of perforation although the false negative rate has been reported as high as 10%.  The study can be done with water-soluble contrast and/or thin barium depending on the preference of the cardiovascular surgeon. The risk of using water-soluble contrast is pulmonary edema if patient aspirates, \nand the risk of using barium is reportedly barium mediastinitis if barium leaks into the  medistinum through a large perforation. \nOf the various causes of esophageal perforation, postemetic spontanous perforation is considered the most morbid secondary to massive contamination and frequently delayed diagnosis. This is in contrast to iatrogenic injuries which are frequently diagnosed at the time of injury. The reported mortality with early primary repair varies widely ranging from 43% (even if the condition is diagnosed and treated less than 24 hours after perforation) to as low as 5% in some reports.  The most important factor in regards to morbidity is the length of time between perforation and repair. On occasion with very small contained perforations the cardiovascular surgeon may elect conservative management, but in the majority of cases immediate surgical repair is necessary.  Conservative management is associated with a 22 to 38% mortality. The difficulty with nonoperative management is prospective determination of which perforation will remain contained and which will cause continued contamination with subsequent uncontrolled infection. Sepsis, shock, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, mediastinal emphysema, and respiratory failure are all absolute indications for rapid surgical interventions.",

The ankle accounts for 4% of all cases of OCD and the tarsal navicular bone is rarely involved. Most commonly, ankle OCD\u2019s are seen in the talar dome. \n\nRadiographically, osteochondritis dissecans is often seen best on a lateral view as a lucent lesion disrupting the articular rim of the involved bone. CT demonstrates the navicular lesions well in both sagittal and coronal reformats, frequently as cortical depressions with a rim of sclerosis. MRI shows osteochondral lesions with low signal intensity on T1 and high signal intensity on T2 sequences (secondary to adjacent edema). Nuclear medicine bone scan typically shows mild to marked focal uptake in the region of the osteochondral defect. \n\nThe pathogenesis of the process is unknown but believed to be related to repetitive trauma, particularly from forces transmitted through the metatarsal rays on plantar flexion of the foot.

This group of disorders is a distinct subset of interstitial lung disease in that a known etiology is not identified.  The idiopathic interstitial pneumonias are classified into groups with similar pathology, disease progression, treatment response and prognosis. The groups include (in decreasing order of incidence): Usual interstitial pneumia (UIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP), bronchioloitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia (BOOP), respiratory bronchiolitis-interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis (LIP) and acute interstitial pneumonitis. \n\nNonspecific interstitial pneumonits (NSIP) is nonclassifiable; meaining it cannot be classified as the other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias.  The patients are typically middle-aged to elderly but tend to be younger than UIP and older than RB-ILD and DIP. NSIP affects females more commonly than males. Presenting symptoms include chronic dry cough, shortness of breath, low-grade fever and malaise.  Chest radiographs may be normal or demonstrate irregular interstitial opacities with or without consolidation. Lung volumes may be normal to slightly decreased.  CT reveals scattered bilateral ground-glass opacities in all patients. Other potential findings include airspace consolidation, linear opacities, bronchial dilatation and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.  A unique feature of NSIP is the lack of honeycombing.\n\nOn biopsy there is typically a uniform appearance of interstitial inflammation. Inflammation only and no fibrosis are seen in the majority (48%) with inflammation and fibrosis (38%) and fibrosis only (14%) less common findings. \n\nNSIP has been related to underlying collagen vascular disease, inhalational exposure, severe pneumonia and ARDS. Therapy is based on immunosuppression including steroids and cytotoxic agents. Clinical and radiographic improvement is seen in 50-86% of patients with an 11% overall mortality.",

Chest x-ray findings include large lung volumes, flattening of the hemidiaphragms, increased retrosternal clear space, increased AP diameter, and distortion of the pulmonary vasculature which usually occur late in the disease.  CT is important in the assessment of emphysema since it can asses the severity and distribution of the disease and reliably differentiate types in patients with mild to moderate forms of the disease.

            "Disease Discussion": "Duplicated renal collecting systems represent renal units with two distinct pyelocalyceal systems associated with either a single or double ureter.  In the case of two distinct ureters, the ureters either join together along their course and form a single ureter, or they both insert individually on the bladder.  This anomaly presents either unilaterally or bilaterally, and is estimated to occur in up to fifteen percent of the population.  Most individuals with a duplicated renal collecting system remain asymptomatic with their anomaly being found incidentally on imaging studies.  Those patients who become symptomatic with their duplicated collecting system generally have two distinct and complete urters, and are prone to developing obstruction, reflux, and infection.\n     A duplicated renal collecing system forms by one of two ways.  The first results from the embryologic bifurcation of a single ureteral bud prior to the bifurcation of the ampulla, and produces either a bifid ureteral pelvis or a bifid ureter which joins distally prior to bladder insertion.  The second results when two distinct embryologic ureteral buds arise from the Wolffian duct, giving rise to two complete and separate ureters which insert separately into the bladder.  In this second case, with two separate ureters, the upper pole ureter drains below and medial to the lower pole ureter at its insertion.  According to the Weigert-Meyer rule, the upper pole ureter is prone to obstruction and hydronephrosis as well as ureterocele formation, while the lower pole ureter is prone to refulx and at is risk for pyleonephritis.  Additionally, this upper pole ureter may insert ectopically inferior to the bladder (e.g. urethera, or vagina), causing continual leakage of urine in females (not the case in males as the ectopic insertion is proximal to the external uretheral sphinter).",

            "Disease Discussion": "Medical anticoagulation represents an important therapeutic option for both treatment of and prophylaxis against thromboembolic disease.  Typically heparing and warfarin are the agents employed.  Unfractionated heparin acts primarily as an indirect thrombin inhibitor, and to a lesser extent as a factor Xa inhibitor.  It has the advantage of fast activity, but presents difficulty with dosing (requiring intravenous administration) and monitoring of the patient's PTT.  Dosing normally follows a nomogram and varies from institution to institution depending upon laboratory ranges.  The introduction of low molecular weight heparin, a factor Xa inhibitor, as an alternative to unfractionated heparin allows easier administration with standard dosing, subcutaneous administration, and no laboratory monitoring.  Alternatively, warfarin, an inhibitor of vitamin K-dependant coagulation factors, is typically used for long term out patient anticoagulation needs owing to its oral administration.  Warfarin is monitored therapeutically on a weekly basis with the patient's PT and INR (standard INR goal 2.0-3.0).\n\nAs is the case with nearly all medical interventions, anticoagulation does not come without potential side-effects.  The most significant of these centers around hemorrhage.  Patients undergoing anticoagulation are at increased risk for bleeding, both following trauma and sponaneously.  Abdominal wall hematomas represent a real and potentially fatal side effect of therapeutic anticoagulation.  Several cases of abdominal wall hemorrhage have been reported in the literature following the initiation of anticoagulation therapy.  In the majority of these cases, bleeding occured spontaneuosly.",

            "History": "Patient presented to the ER in Jan2003 with 2 day history of fever, night sweats, groin pain, anorexia, nausea, and fatigue. Approximately 2 weeks prior to presentation the patient was seen by PCP for low-grade fevers and mild groin pain that radiated to her hip and back. She was diagnosed with groin strain and prescribed Flexeril. The patient continued to experience intermittent fevers and progressively worsening pain in her hip and groin despite frequent use of Flexeril. The pain was noted to be particularly bad while climbing stairs that would improve with sitting and rest. There were otherwise no changes in her bowel habits or stool quality (2-3 loose stools/day), no urinary symptoms, chest pain, dispnea, hemoptysis, or musculoskeletal trauma. The patient also denied a history of chronic gastrointestinal disease. She had an appendectomy 10 years ago. Past medical history also significant for a right sided nephrectomy in 2002 for an angiolipoma. Post-operative course complicated by a septic hematoma in the right kidney fossa, pneumonia and deep venous thromboses (DVTs). In 2003 an IVC Greenfield filter was placed for recurrent DVTs unresponsive to anticoagulation therapy.  Medications Flexeril, Aygestin (for Menorrhagia), Progestin and Coumadin.",
            "Exam": "Patient was normotensive, tachycardic, and febrile. The abdomen was without rashes, distention, tenderness, masses, hepatosplenomegaly, guarding or rebound, and bowel sounds were present throughout. The right groin area was tender to mild palpation. The patient had tenderness with passive extension of right thigh (a positive psoas sign) and no tenderness with passive internal rotation of flexed thigh (negative obdurator sign). The physical exam was otherwise unremarkable.\nLabs:  CBC: 20>12.1/36.5<350; basic metabolic panel: wnl; urinalysis abnormal for high amount of blood; stool guaiac negative",
            "Findings": "Frontal view of the abdomen shows an abnormal psoas shadow (i.e. blurring of the right psoas muscle edge).\nAxial images from CECT (IV and oral) of the abdomen and pelvis at L2 or L3 shows a rim enhanced low-attenuation mass in the right posterior abdomen in close proximity to the cecum laterally, extending medially into the psoas muscle. Additional axial images shows that the mass is fusiform and extends from approximately T12 into the pelvis along the psoas muscle.",
            "Differential Diagnosis": "Abdominal plain film:  retroperitoneal inflammatory process resulting in fluid or pus accumulation, retroperitoneal malignancy (primary or metastatic), hematoma\nCT with IV and oral contrast: Abscess (ruptured appendix/diverticulum, Crohn\u2019s disease with fistula formation, chronic pyelonephritis, spreading infection from the spine), Neoplastic (locally invasive colon cancer/ renal cell carcinoma, metastatic cancer, lymphoma)",
            "Case Diagnosis": "Psoas abscess",
            "Treatment & Follow Up": "Following an unsuccessful attempted CT guided percutaneous aspiration of the abscess under local anesthetic, the abscess was surgically incised and drained of approximately 150  milliliters of purulent material containing gram positive cocci (cultures revealed Group A Streptococcus) The patient was then placed on triple antibiotic therapy until the end of her hospital stay",
            "Discussion": "Psoas abscess is an uncommon and potentially deadly disease usually following a protracted and insidious course. Classically a patient with a psoas abscess presents with a triad of complaints of flank pain, a prolonged fever, and a limitation in hip movement, however, other symptoms include a pain or mass in the thigh,loin or flank, malaise, weight loss, and a flexion contracture of the hip joint. When the cause of the infection is not identifiable the psoas abscess is considered \u201cprimary\u201d, otherwise, it is \u201csecondary\u201d. In the US 60% of psoas abscess cases are primary, 88% of which are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. For cases involving a secondary psoas abscess the most significant cause is Crohn\u2019s disease; local infectious processes involving the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and bones are also significant causes. In this patient the psoas abscess was located on the same side that a heminephrectomy was performed a year prior to presentation suggesting a possible link. There are a few reported cases of psoas abscess formation following nephrectomy.\n\nBecause of the insidious nature and variation in clinical presentation of this disease the diagnosis is often delayed. Plainfilm, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) have proven useful in the diagnosis. On plainfilm a psoas abscess may appear as a mass or blur the ipsilateral psoas muscle edge. Ultrasound (US) is a rapid screening method for identifying a retroperitoneal abscess which appears as an hypoechoic mass. However, US cannot identify the cause of the abscess and requires an experienced technician. CT has the highest sensitivity for diagnosing psoas abscess and remains the method of choice for describing the structure of the lesion and identifying the underlying cause.\n\nTreatment of the abscess typically begins with a CT guided biopsy followed by drainage and antibiotic therapy. If at all possible the abscess should be drained via the less invasive method of radiological guided percutaneous needle aspiration; however, if this fails, open surgical drainage should be performed."

            "Disease Discussion": "Congenital absence of the pericardium is a rare anomaly which usually (67%) occurs on the left side. A complete form exists and is usually diagnosed incidentally. Normally, the aortopulmonary window is covered by pericardium and contains some fat.  Left sided pericardial absence absence allows interposition of lung between the aorta and and the main segment of the pulmonary artery. The defect usually causes the heart to rotate to the left.  Sometimes, the left atrial appendage can bulge through the defect. Associated congenital heart defects include atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, mitral valve stenosis, or tetralogy of Fallot.\n\nClinical: \nPatients are often asymptomatic and the defect is found incidentally. The defect may cause herniation and strangulation of parts of the left heart. Symptoms can include syncope, chest pain or arrhythmias. Death may be caused by torsion of the great arteries, constriction of a coronary artery or herniation and/or incarceration of the left atrial appendage.\n\nImaging:\nChest x-ray shows left-sided displacement and posterior bulging of the heart. Herniation of the left atrial appendage resembles enlargement of the pulmonary artery. On echocardiography excessive cardiac motion and enlargement of the left atrial appendage may be seen. Definitive diagnosis can by obtained with  MRI and CT.   Interposition of lung between the aorta and left pulmonary artery is diagnostic.\n\nTreatment:\nThe defect can be enlarged or patched surgically to alleviate herniation.",

Additionally, any immunocompromised patient may be affected; organ recipients on immunosuppressive treatment, oncologic and hematologic patients, the elderly, severely malnourished children, and patients requiring prolonged corticosteroid therapy.\n\nThe most common radiographic finding in patients with PCP consists of diffuse, bilateral symmetric ground-glass reticulonodular, or finely granular opacities occurring in a perihilar, or lower lung zone distribution.  Less commonly, PCP will occur with upper lobe predominance.  If untreated, these opacities may manifest as diffuse air space consolidation. As the disease progresses, interstitial disease will become more pronounced, and air cysts may be noticed in 5% to 35% of patients.  Occasionally, single or multiple nodules, miliary nodules, cavitation, hilar or mediastinal adenopathy, and pleural effusion will be identified.  CT typically demonstrates symmetric bilateral ground-glass opacities, which may be diffuse, or have a mosaic pattern with sharp transitions between normal and abnormal lung giving a \u201ccrazy-paving\u201d pattern. Spontaneous pneumothorax may be identified in 5% to 10% of patients, and is more common when cysts are present.   Pneumomediastinum may also be evident occurring by itself or in concert with pneumothorax.\n\nMost patients have characteristic radiographic findings of PCP, eliminating the need for CT.  However, in patients with symptoms and atypical radiographic findings, CT may show ground-glass opacities, that when correlated with the CD4+ count and other clinical markers may allow the correct diagnosis of PCP to be made.  Other causes of ground-glass opacities in patients with AIDS include CMV pneumonia and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia.\n\nClinically, patients with PCP demonstrate nonspecific complaints.  Fever, cough, progressive dyspnea on exertion, weight loss, night sweats, and chest pain are all common symptoms.  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are frequently elevated, and patients demonstrate restrictive patterns on pulmonary function tests, with hypoxemia when exercising.  Clinicians may employ induced sputums, or use bronchoscopy with BAL to clinch the diagnosis.  BAL which has close to 100% sensitivity and 89% specificity in diagnosing PCP, is useful when positive, however when results are negative, transbronchial or open lung biopsy may be pursued when the clinical findings suggest a high probability of PCP.  Patients will often begin empirical therapy in the absence of definitive diagnosis to avoid potential complications.\n\nSummary: Perihilar and bilateral lower lobe reticular opacities on chest radiography in a patient with a CD4 count less than 200 cells/mm3 suggests PCP.",

            "Discussion": "Hyperglycemia is associated with damage to the basal ganglia (BG).  Proposed mechanisms include selective vulnerability, altered BG metabolism, breakdown of the blood brain barrier, hyper-viscosity of blood, and underlying small vessel disease.\n\nThe appearance of a hyperdense infarction on CT is often related to re-perfusion.  This may be seen following thrombolysis, especially after a contrast injection.  In this patient, without a contrast injection, there must be another explanation for the high attenuation.  On the non-contrast CT, the hyper attenuation could be due to microscopic extravasated RBCs - but it is not confluent like a hematoma.  \n\nThe subacute (3 days) MRI findings might also be explained by intact  RBCs, extravasated - with intracellular met-hemoglobin.  Intracellular methemoglobin is bright on T1W and dark on T2W - just as shown in this case.  Lysed RBCs, with extracellular methemoglobin, is bright on both T1 and T2.\n\nThere are, however, other explanations for T1W bright/T2 dark putamen in non-ketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea/hemiballismus - including reactive astrogliosis with manganese accumulation.

Chorea-ballismus with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus.\nAJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 1996 Jun-Jul;17(6):1057-64.\n\nAbstract\nPURPOSE: To describe the neuroimaging (Ct, MR, and single-photon emission CT [SPECT]) findings in a series of patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus and to correlate the imaging findings with the clinical presentation.\n\nMETHODS: The neuroimaging and clinical data from 10 patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus were evaluated. Family and drug histories, as well as other causes of chorea, were excluded. All 10 patients had CT, 5 also had MR imaging, and 3 had SPECT examinations. Three had follow-up CT and MR imaging studies, and MR findings were correlated with CT findings in 5 cases. Two experienced neuroradiologists, aware of the diagnosis but blinded to the clinical status of the patients, evaluated all images and reached a consensus as to the final\ninterpretation.\n\nRESULTS: CT studies in 9 of 10 patients showed a hyperdense putamen and/or caudate nucleus; in 1, the CT findings were normal. T1-weighted MR images in all 5 patients who had MR imaging (including the patient with a normal CT study) showed hyperintense lesions without significant T2 signal alternation at the basal ganglia. In all 3 of the patients who had SPECT studies of the brain, the scans revealed hypoperfusion at corresponding areas. All 3 follow-up studies depicted resolution of the lesions in the abnormal basal ganglia. Increased hypointensity on T2-weighted and gradient-echo T2*-weighted images was also\nobserved in the sequential MR images. In all patients, the initial side of involvement correlated well with the neuroimaging findings. The chorea resolved within 2 days after treatment of the hyperglycemia in 9 patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: In patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus, CT and T1-weighted MR images show unilateral or bilateral lesions of the putamen and/or caudate. SPECT scans show hypoperfusion. These findings may be related to petechial hemorrhage and/or myelin destruction. Early recognition of these imaging characteristics may facilitate diagnosis of primary diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia and prompt appropriate therapy.\n\nPMID: 8791916",

            "Disease Discussion": "Small bowel cancer in uncommon with about 4,600 cases reported annually in the United States (total incidence of 1.4 per 100,000 patients).  Types of small bowel cancer include adenocarcinoma, carcinoid, lymphoma and sarcoma. \nPrimary adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is a rare entity accounting for less than 1% of all primary GI malignant tumors.  The small bowel contains more than 75 percent of the length and about 90 percent of the mucosal surface area of the gastrointestinal tract but is the least common site of primary cancer within the GI tract. It is much more uncommon than colorectal cancer, gastric or esophageal cancer.  Conditions with higher incidence of small bowel adenocarcinoma include familial polyposis, AIDS, Peutz-Jeghers, Lynch II syndrome, celiac disease and Crohns disease.  \nMalignant small bowel tumors tend to be symptomatic; whereas, benign tumors are often found incidentally. Symptoms initially are vague including abdominal pain, weight loss, occult fecal blood (50%) and jaundice (33% of duodenal tumors). 1/2 to 2/3 of cases are discovered late in their course at emergency laparotomy for obstructive symptoms. The most common location for adenocarcinoma to occur is in the duodenum. \nBarium studies and CT can both be helpful for detecting small bowel adenocarcinoma. Small bowel follow-through sensitivity is 50-80 percent.  Enteroclysis has higher sensitivity, but requires greater technical skill.\nOn CT the tumor typically appears as focal bowel wall nodular thickening and may have a soft tissue mass extending into the mesentery. CT can be helpful for evaluating the extent of extraluminal disease, including local extension, lymph nodes and distant metastasis. \n5-year survival after diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the small bowel is 20-30%.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Nephrolithiasis classically presents with renal colic and hematuria.  Stones within the renal collecting system typically obstruct at one of three locations: the ureteropelvic junction, the pelvic brim, or the ureterovessicular junction.  Occasionally obstructing stones may also lodge at the bladder outlet.  When acute in onset, many patients with obstructing stone disease will present to the emergency department with acute flank pain.  The differential diagnosis consideration for such presentations can often include appendicitis, pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, and inflammatory bowel disease.  For this reason imaging typically plays an important role in diagnosis.  A study from Radiology in 2000 looking at the detection of ureteral calculi in emergency room patients determined that the sensitivity for stone detection by CT was 96%, and by ultrasound was 61% (both with specificities of 100%).\n\nIt is estimated that somewhere between 3 and 12 percent of individuals in the United States will experience symptomatic renal stones at some point in their lives.  The majority of stones (eighty percent) are composed of calcium (typically calcium oxalate and less often calcium phosphate).  The main other types include include uric acid, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and cystine stones.  Generalized risk factors for forming stones include low water intake, high protein intake, family history, urinary tract infection with a urease splitting organism (e.g. Proteus or Klebsiella), and disease states resulting in hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, or hypocitriuria.  Treatment of ureteral stones in the acute setting begins with adequate pain control. Once an obstructing stone has been identified within the collecting system, location and size of the stone plays a major role in determining management with stone size of 5mm typically representing the threshold for intervention\u2014with stones smaller than 5mm being managed conservatively (pain control, oral hydration, and urine straining for spontaneous passage), and stones greater than or equal to 5mm being managed with some sort of intervention (e.g. lithotripsy, cystoscopy, etc).",

Despite their benign taxonomy, a majority of these benign lesions tend to recur, therefore making wide excision standard regardless of malignant potential.",
            "Discussion": "Paraspinal masses can invoke an enormous list of differential diagnoses: lymphoma, metastatic disease, nerve sheath tumors, primary bone tumors, myeloma, meningocele, cysts, abscesses, and beyond.  Based on location and radiographic appearance, this particular patient's findings suggested a neoplastic process, which directed him to biopsy.  Indeed biopsy results initially indicated that a primary bone neoplasm was probable, based on presence of osteoblasts and cartilage.\n\nPrimary bone tumors are relatively rare, with an incidence of approximately 10,000 cases a year in the US.  Using the patient's demographics as well as radiographic features can narrow the differential significantly.  The suspected neoplasms, with the exception of chondrosarcoma, fit this patient\u2019s age group, as all frequently present in the second and third decades (chondrosarcoma has a peak incidence in the 5th and 6th decades of life). Using mass location to assign a probably diagnosis, an osteoblastoma becomes likely as it is often found in the spinal elements. By histology, of the differentials listed, the primary bone neoplasms seem most probable as those tumors are associated with chondro-osseous derivatives.  More distinctively, the radiographic features suggest that there is a cystic component to the tumor, likely aneurysmal bone cysts.  Because only a small fraction of the tumor contains these structures, they are likely to be secondary versus a primary aneurysmal bone cyst.\n\nWhen considering primary bone tumors with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst components, the differential is further pointed.  Only 5 types of primary bone tumors typically display this pattern:  giant cell tumor of bone, osteoblastoma, chondroblastoma, fibrous dysplasia, and telangiectatic osteosarcoma.\n\nFinal pathology reading of the core biopsy revealed the tumor was a chondroblastoma.  This is a very rare tumor, and even rarer is the location of the tumor in this patient.  Chondroblastomas account for less than 1% of all bone tumors; this corresponds to approximately 100 cases a year, considering the scarcity of primary bone tumors in general.  Additionally, nearly 75% of the cases occur in the long bones of the lower extremity - distal femur and proximal tibia/fibula.  Another 20% of chondroblastomas occur in the humerus, while a small fraction has also been reported in the small bones of the hand and feet.  Case reports have described these tumors occurring in the skull, mandible, maxilla, vertebra, ribs, scapula, patella, and sternum.\n\nThis patient fits the expected demographics of the majority of primary bone tumors: second decade in age, male, black, history of chronic pain.  What is so profound regarding this case remains the specific type of primary bone tumor, given its rarity by statistical incidence, and its unusual location originating from the ninth rib.\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nBullough, Peter.

            "Disease Discussion": "The plain film findings of a small bowel obstruction will vary according to the duration of symptoms, the site of obstruction and the type of obstructing lesion.  Once an obstruction has occurred, gastric, pancreatic, biliary and small bowel fluid as well as swallowed air will begin to collect proximal to the obstruction dilating the small bowel and causing colicky symptoms.  Distal to the obstruction the bowel contents will empty.  The eventual radiographic picture is that of dilated small bowel with air fluid levels and a preponderance of fluid with little if any gas distal in the small intestine or colon.  If the bowel dilates with air it assumes a step ladder configuration.  Differential air fluid levels within the same intestinal loop can be seen in either an adynamic ileus or a bowel obstruction and are not helpful in distinguishing the two.  The presence of a large amount of fluid is more suggestive of an obstruction.  If small amounts of air are trapped in between the plicae circulares, a line of small round air collections, the \"string of pearls,\" (Film .2Z) can be seen, as in this case.  This finding is indicative of large amounts of fluid and is more suggestive of an obstruction than an adynamic ileus.  The extent of small bowel gas may be a clue as to the site of the obstruction.  Proximal obstructions may result in a fairly benign appearing radiograph.  One third of patients will present with a history and plain film findings sufficiently characteristic that further radiographic work-up is unnecessary.  If a contrast study is performed, barium is the agent of choice because water soluble contrast material becomes too dilute to pin-point a site of obstruction.  Administering the barium through an already indwelling long arm tube or radiographically placed duodenal catheter may be a more expeditious way of pin-pointing the site of a partial obstruction.  With a complete obstruction it is difficult to get the barium column to reach the site of a distal obstruction using any technique without causing the patient either increased discomfort or emesis of the barium.  Many surgeons are content with supportive plain films and clinical history to justify a surgical approach.  \n\nApproximately 60% of mechanical small bowel obstructions occur because of adhesions.  Approximately 20% of obstructions are from hernias, the vast majority of which are external hernias.  Included in this group are inguinal, femoral, umbilical and incisional hernias.  The diagnosis of an incisional hernia can be very difficult and requires oblique views of the abdomen.  Obstructing inguinal hernias in adults are usually symptomatic and readily apparent.  In the neonate, however, an obstructing inguinal hernia may be difficult to diagnose clinically.  A close search for air below the pubic ramus should always be made when a small bowel obstruction is present.  Internal hernias account for less than 5% of obstructing hernias and rarely have a specific enough plain film picture to allow for diagnosis.  \n\nA rounded soft tissue density associated with an obstructed small bowel pattern should always raise the possibility of a closed loop obstruction, representing a twisted or adhesed isolated loop of intestine blocked at both ends.  Other causes of small bowel obstruction include benign or malignant primary tumors, large gallstones, intussusceptions, Crohn's disease, and perforated appendix with abscess formation.\n\nIt should be remembered that the plain film diagnosis of a small bowel obstruction should be made with correlation with the patient's clinical picture.  A single series of films is frequently insufficient and sequential films may be necessary.",

            "Disease Discussion": "ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION (AVM)\n\nClinical Features:  AVMs are the most common symptomatic congenital vascular malformations.  The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related\u201d aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

            "Title": "Recurrent pyrogenic cholangitis",
            "Disease Discussion": "An unusual form of recurrent pyogenic cholangitis occurs in Orientals and asian immigrants and is characterized by an extreme propensity for intraductal stone formation.  The bile ducts become filled with stones (usually pigment stones), pus and sludge-like material.  The intra- and extrahepatic ducts become focally and irregularly dilated secondary to multiple strictures.  Distal obstruction is not usually present.  Biliary cirrhosis from longstanding obstruction may ultimately develop.  The disease seems to involve the left ductal system more severely.\n\nYoung adults are most commonly affected.  Clinical symptoms include fever, chills, RUQ pain and jaundice.  Septic shock and liver abscess may develop.\n\nThe etiology of this condition is debated.  Multiple pathogenic factors are proposed, including repeated infections with enteric organisms, malnutrition, parasitic infestation and portal bacteremia.  It is postulated that enteric bacteria deconjugate bilirubin and predispose to pigment calculi formation.  Parasitic infection with Clonorchis sinensis or Fasciola hepatica commonly coexist and may contribute to the pathogenesis.  However the most common organism culture from the bile in patients with RPC is E. coli\n\nThe diagnosis is often suggested on CT or US by asymmetric or patchy intrahepatic ductal dilatation and intra- and extrahepatic duct calculi.  The disease most commonly effects the lateral left lobe.  Calculi are multiple, vary in size, consistency and color and are frequently non-calcified.  Air in the bile ducts (with no previous surgery), contrast enhancement of the ductal walls, and parenchymal changes of segmental atrophy, fatty change and hepatic abscesses may also be identified on CT.  CT should be done without oral or IV contrast initially.  Intrahepatic calculi are more easily detected on non-enhanced scans, and oral contrast refluxing through an anastomosis may obscure calculi.\n\nOn sonography, the biliary sludge and amorphous intrahepatic calculi can be missed, appearing as soft tissue density without an acoustic shadow and obscuring visibility of dilated intrahepatic ducts.  Pneumobilia may be mistaken for intrahepatic calculi.  Biliary  Direct cholangiography with PTC or ERCP is used to delineate specific details but must be done carefully with prophylactic antibiotics.\n\nThere is a high recurrence rate in this disease.  Medical therapy is ineffective.  Percutaneous or endoscopic drainage, stone removal and stricture dilatation are useful in management.  Resection of the affect portion of the liver and choledocojejunostomy may be performed to improve biliary drainage and protect the unaffected portions of the liver.  Some surgeons elect to create a stoma from the afferent loop of jejunum to the skin to allow easy access to the biliary system if further intervention is necessary.",

PAPVC from the right lung is twice as common as PAPVC from the left lung.  \n\nThe main differential for a vertically oriented vessel lateral and to the left of the aortic arch is PAPVR and Left Sided SVC. A quick way to differentiate PAPVR from Persistent Left Sided Superior Vena Cava is to look at the size of the coronary sinus.  In persistent left sided SVC venous return is to the coronary sinus and the coronary sinus will be enlarged while it is not in PAPVR.  PAPVR may have feeding intraparenchymal pulmonary veins not seen in left SVC. MR phase contrast can show cephalad flow in PAPVR and caudal flow in left sided SVC.",

            "Disease Discussion": "A hiatal hernia is a protrusion of the upper part of the stomach into the thorax through a tear or weakness in the diaphragm.\n\nTYPES OF HIATAL HERNIA \u2014 4 Types\nType I: Sliding hernia \u2014 accounts for more than 95 percent of cases.\n-Characterized by a widening of the muscular hiatal tunnel and circumferential laxity of the phrenoesophageal membrane, allowing a portion of the gastric cardia to herniate upward. \n-In terms of diagnosis, those larger than 2 cm can be diagnosed by barium swallow.  However, in order to detect small hiatal hernias, one must use high-resolution manometry.\n-Etiology-trauma, congenital malformation, and iatrogenic factors. \n-Prognosis-Most small hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. With larger type I hernias, the main clinical implication is the propensity to develop gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). \n\nType II, III, and IV: Paraesophageal hernias  \u2014 account for up to 5 percent of all hiatal hernias. \nEtiology: usually unclear, but a recognized complication of surgical dissection of the hiatus as occurs during antireflux procedures, esophagomyotomy, or partial gastrectomy.\n-Description: As the hernia enlarges, the greater curvature of the stomach rolls up into the thorax. Because the stomach is fixed at the gastroesophageal junction, the herniated stomach tends to rotate around its longitudinal axis, resulting in an organoaxial volvulus. \n-Diagnosis: barium swallow or endoscopy. If the hernia involves organs other than just the stomach, a definitive diagnosis is established with CT or MRI.\n\nTypes III and IV hiatal hernias are variants of the type II hernia:\n-Type III -with progressive enlargement of the hernia through the hiatus, the phrenoesophageal membrane stretches, displacing the gastroesophageal junction above the diaphragm. \n-Type IV hiatus hernia is associated with a large defect in the phrenoesophageal membrane, allowing other organs, such as the colon, spleen, pancreas, and small intestine, to enter the hernia sac. \n\nSYMPTOMS \u2014 usually discovered as a finding on upper gastrointestinal studies or endoscopy. \nType II-vague, intermittent symptoms, epigastric or substernal pain, postprandial fullness, substernal fullness, nausea, and retching. An upright radiograph of the thorax may be diagnostic, revealing a retrocardiac air-fluid level within a paraesophageal hernia or intrathoracic stomach. \n\nTREATMENT \u2014 Repair of an isolated, asymptomatic type I hiatal hernia is rarely indicated. If symptoms of GERD occur in association with a large hiatus hernia, either medical or surgical treatment is indicated to control the reflux.\nIn contrast, the enlarging types II, III, and IV hernias pose a constant risk of serious complications. These hernias never regress and progressively enlarge. If left untreated, the paraesophageal hernia eventually reaches the stage of the giant intrathoracic stomach, at which point the prognosis is poor and the complication rate is high. Thus, once a paraesophageal hernia is identified, it should be treated surgically even in the absence of symptoms.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The majority of hemangiomas that involve bone are discovered incidentally in asymptomatic patients. Men are affected twice as often as women, and lesions are usually discovered in the 4th 5th decades of life. Soft-tissue components may also be associated with these lesions. Osseous hemangioma is particularly common in the spine and calvaria and less frequently affects long bones such as the tibia, femur, and humerus. \n\nOsseous hemangiomas may have radiating trabecular thickening on radiographs. Another common pattern is a bubbly bone lysis that creates a honeycomb, latticelike, or \"hole-within-hole\" appearance. These lytic areas are invariably multifocal and usually metaphyseal or epiphyseal. Bone lysis can have linear and circular components on radiographs, suggestive of a vascular lesion, with linear and circular elements representing vascular channels seen longitudinally and en face, respectively. However, these serpentine vascular channels are recognized more easily with CT and MR imaging. Characteristically, these channels have low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images because of slow blood flow. In arteriovenous lesions with faster blood flow, low signal intensity may persist with all MR imaging pulse sequences. The appearance of osseous hemangiomas at bone and red blood cell labeled scintigraphy is variable, from photopenia to moderate increased activity. \n\nPeriosteal or cortical hemangiomas occur most frequently in the anterior tibial diaphysis. These lytic cortical lesions may also show the characteristic multifocal vascular channels or be seen as a larger, nonspecific region of bone destruction. Cortical hemangiomas may predispose the bone to fracture, and periosteal reaction may accompany these lesions.",

            "Title": "Wilms Tumor",
            "Disease Discussion": "Wilms tumor (nephroblastoma) is the most common renal malignancy in children and the 4th most common pediatric malignancy in the U.S.  Diagnosis is usually between 2 and 5 years of age with a peak at around 3 years.  5 to 10 percent involve both kidneys with a median onset about 10 months earlier than unilateral involvement.\n\nWilms tumor most commonly presents as an asymptomatic abdominal mass but may present with abdominal pain, particularly if there is intratumoral hemorrhage.\n\nImaging considerations when evaluating suspected Wilms tumor:\n- Usually appears as large well-defined mass on CT or MRI\n- Tumors commonly appear solid, however, larger lesions may have areas of heterogeneity or cystic components due to previous hemorrhage or necrosis\n- Tumor arises from the Kidney producing classic \u201cclaw sign\u201d with renal parenchyma surrounding a portion of the more hypodense mass.\n- Tends to have spherical growth displacing vessels\n- It is also important to document and evaluate for the following features:\no Lymph node involvement\no Lung metastases\no Contralateral kidney involvement\no Renal vein and IVC involvement\no Path ureters in relation to mass if visualized\no Other anomalies, i.e. gonadal, they may raise suspicion of a syndrome.  See below.\n\nAn increase risk of Wilms tumor has been associated with several syndromes.  Although syndrome association accounts for less than 10 percent of tumors, syndrome possibility should be considered when evaluating for Wilms.  Syndromes include:\n\n1.  WAGR syndrome (wilms, aniridia, genital anomalies, mental retardation).\n- 33% chance in developing Wilms tumor.\n- Studies on WAGR patients led to identification of first Wilms tumor associated gene (WT1). Tumors manifestation is thought to follow the \u201c Two hit\u201d theory with the syndrome producing the first hit.\n2.  Denys-Drash syndrome (gonadal dysgenesis, gonadoblastoma, early onset renal failure).\n- 90% develop Wilms tumor.\n- Bi-allelic inactivation of WT1.\n3.  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (organomegaly, macroglossia, hemihypertorphy, adrenal cytomegaly)\n- 5% chance of developing Wilms tumor\n- Thought to involve second locus (WT2).\n\nThe primary differential in evaluating a possible Wilms tumor is to distinguish it from a neuroblastoma (the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood). Specifically, by determining if the mass arises from the kidney and therefore most likely a Wilms tumor or whether it arises from the suprarenal region and more likely a neuroblastoma. The table below outlines differentiating features between the two.  Tissue pathology, however, is usually obtained to definitively distinguish between the two and rule out more rare renal pathology in this age group such as renal cell carcinoma.\n\n\nFeature\t                Neuroblastoma\t               Wilms Tumor\nAge\t               Most common <2yrs             Peak at 3 yrs\nGrowth                   Surrounds/engulfs               Grows like ball     \n                                vessels                                 displacing vessels\nRelation to kidney\tInferiorly displaces             Arises from kidney\n                                                                                \"claw sign\"\nLung metastasis\tUncommon\t          More common (20%)\nVascular invasion\tDoes not occur\t       Invasion of renal vein/IVC \n                                                                        is common\nCalcification\tCommon (85% on CT)\tLess common (15%)\nAdapted from Donnelly, 2008.\n\nThere are two predominate schools of thought in regards to staging and treatment of Wilms tumor.  The Nation Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) advocates for a surgery up-front approach allowing for a more accurate histologic and tumor extent assessment. The International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) advocates for chemotherapy first which reduces tumor volume and likely the possibility of tumor spillage during removal.  Both stratagies use their own somewhat complicated staging system but generally follow the more simplistic outline below.  \n\nI.\tConfined to kidney\nII.\tExtension into perinephric spaces\nIII.\tLymphnode involvement\nIV.\tMets to liver/lung\nV.\tBilateral kidney involvement\n\nIt is important to note that due to the differences in surgical timing and variations in criteria a \u201cstage to stage\u201d comparison of the two staging systems is confounded. It is also important to note the histologic characteristics are felt to be a more powerful prognostic indicator for Wilms.\n\nThe prognosis for Wilms tumor is generally good with excellent results obtained with a combination of nephrectomy and chemotherapy in most cases. Survival rates are reported as high as 90% which includes tumors that have spread beyond the kidney.  Tumors with diffuse anaplasia have a less favorable outcome and reinforce the importance of correctly identifying the histologic pattern.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Portal venous gas is usually due to an extension of air within the mesenteric venous system and associated bowel, or pneumatosis intestinalis. Pneumatosis intestinalis occurs in two distinct forms, primary (15%) and secondary (85%). Primary penumatosis occurs as an idiopathic entity secondary to formation of thin walled cysts within the submucosa of the bowel wall. Secondary pneumatosis is generally related to disease of the bowel wall, or may occur secondary to pulmonary disease.  \n\nDisruption of the normal mucosa by infection, trauma, ischemia/necrosis, surgery, or secondary to medication allows air to move into the submucosal spaces, where it tracks peripherally around the bowel wall. If enough air is collected within the bowel wall, it eventually spills into the mesenteric venous system, and then will begin to track superiorly and fill the portal venous system.  \n\nRadiographically, pneumatosis appears as multiple thin, curvilinear lucencies surrounding the bowel lumen within the bowel wall. It will be seen within the dependant and non-dependant portions of the bowel, often outlined by adjacent fluid filling the bowel lumen. On CT, gas may be noted to fill the mesenteric vasculature, collecting and eventually spreading to the portal venous system more centrally.  If enough gas is present, air may fill the portal venous vasculature of the liver and will appear as thin linear streaks branching out towards the periphery of the liver from a central location.  Differentiating portal venous from biliary gas may be difficult on plain films, however usually portal venous gas will be seen to within 2cm of the peripheral edge of the liver, while biliary gas generally appears more centrally.  On CT, air may be followed centrally within the liver and its location determined after observing collections within the main portal vein or common bile ducts. \n\nRadiographs will demonstrate pneumatosis and portal venous gas in approximately 2/3 of patients, however the underlying cause can often not be determine with plain films.  CT will more definitively demonstrate the extent of pneumatosis/portal venous gas, and will additionally give further clues as to the source of the problem, i.e bowel ischemia, obstruction, inflammation, etc. Once the source is identified, prompt surgical or medical treatment should be started in order to treat the underlying pathological process.",

            "Title": "Acute appendicitis",
            "Disease Discussion": "Appendicitis occurs most frequently in the 2nd to 3rd decade of life, less commonly in the extremes of age.  Pain is usually the initial presenting complaint and often starts in the peri-umbilical region before migrating to the right lower quadrant with maximal tenders often located at McBurney\u2019s point.  This typical sequence is absent in more than 1/3 of older children.  Often pain is worse with movement, coughing (cough sign) driving over bump (cat\\'s eye sign), or standing on toes and dropping heels to ground (heel drop sign) (Rothrock).  Vomiting occurs in the majority of school-aged children and may precede or begin concurrent with pain.  Physical exam often reveals an elevated temperature and tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant.  However, tenderness may involve the entire lower abdomen, or may be diffuse, especially with a perforation.  Compared with those with non-perforated appendicitis, children with perforated appendicitis are significantly younger, have a longer duration of symptoms before diagnosis, have more physician visits before correct diagnosis, have higher temperatures, and are more likely to exhibit vomiting, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and peritoneal signs (Rothrock).  Perforation generally occurs 36 to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.     Plain abdominal radiographs have been recommended as potentially useful for evaluating children with suspected appendicitis.  Radiographic findings believed to be suggestive of appendicitis include rightward scoliosis, soft tissue masses, localized ileus, bowel obstruction, calcified fecolith, and free peritoneal fluid.  Of these features, the most specific for appendicitis is a calcified fecolith (appendicolith) found in up to 13% to 22% with appendicitis and in only 1% to 2% of those without (Rothrock).  While often recommended, these films rarely altered a patient\\'s diagnosis or management.       Ultrasonography is appropriate in patients in which the diagnosis is unclear by history and physical examination, especially in pediatric and female patients.  A normal appendix must be identified to rule out appendicitis.  An inflamed appendix usually measures greater than 6 mm in diameter, is non-compressible and tender with focal compression (Hardin).  Numerous other right lower quadrant conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cecal diverticulitis, Meckel\\'s diverticulum, endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease can cause false-positive ultrasonography results (Hardin).       Appendiceal CT is more accurate than ultrasound and consists of a focused, helical CT after a Gastrografin-saline enema.  It can be performed and interpreted usually within an hour.  The accuracy of CT is due in part to its ability to identify a normal appendix better than ultrasound.  If appendiceal CT is not available, standard abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast remains useful and may still be more accurate than ultrasound (Hardin).     The standard for management of appendicitis remains appendectomy.  The procedure may be performed by laparotomy (usually through a small right lower quadrant incision) or laparoscopy.  While laparoscopic intervention is advantageous in adults due to decreased postoperative pain, earlier return to normal activity and better cosmetic results, an open appendectomy remains the primary approach to treatment in children due to their smaller size (Rothrock).\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15155894",

The uvea is subdivided into the iris, the ciliary body, and the choroids.  Most choroidal melanomas are believed to develop from preexisting melaanocytic nevi.  The estimated prevalence is five to seven cases per 1 million adults, occurring most commonly in people of northern European descent.  Sixty-five percent of melanomas occur in those older than 50 years.  Patients may be asymptomatic with lesions discovered during a routine ophthalmologic examination.  Other patients may notice vision loss, photopsia, and visual field deficits.  \n\nMelanomas primarily metastasize to the liver, as well as to the lung, bone, kidney, and brain.  Treatment is dependent on site of origin, size, location of the primary lesion, and on the presence of extraocular extension, recurrence, or metastases.  Melanomas greater than 1 cm in thickness are managed with enucleation.  Medium sized lesions (3 mm to 1 cm) may be managed with enucleation, plaque brachytherapy and external-beam radiation.  Small tumors (<3 mm in thickness) are monitored every 3-6 months with US.  \n\nUveal melanomas are usually assessed by ophthalmologic examination, fluorescein angiography, US, CT or MR imaging.  On unenhanced CT, these lesions appear elevated, hyperdense, are sharply marginated, and following contrast administration avidly enhance.  At MR imaging, most melanomas appear as well-defined solid masses that are hyperintense on T1-weighted images, and hypointense on T2-weighted images secondary to the paramagnetic effects of melanin.  Contrast enhanced fat-suppressed MR images are useful to demonstrate scleral invasion, tumor extension to the optic disc, and extraocular invasion.",

            "Title": "PRIMARY CHOLESTEATOMA",
            "Disease Discussion": "Introduction:  The term cholesteatoma is a misnomer coined by Johannes Muller in 1838. Initially described as a layered pearly tumor of fat containing biliary fat or cholestrin interspersed among sheets of polyhedral cells.  Cholesteatomas actually do not contain fat but are composed of an outer matrix which surrounds layers of desquamated epithelium. The matrix is comprised of differentiated keratinized squamous epithelium in a collagen matrix.\nIncidence:  The incidence of cholesteatomas is unknown, but it is a relatively common reason for otologic surgery. Death from intracranial complications of a cholesteatoma is uncommon, due to early recognition, timely surgical intervention, and supportive antibiotic therapy. Cholesteatomas remain a relatively common cause of permanent, moderate conductive hearing loss in children and adults. \nTypes:  Cholesteatoma may be classified according to presumed etiology into two general categories: congenital and acquired.  Acquired cholesteatomas can be further divided into primary and secondary acquired.  \nCongenital: (2%)  Congenital cholesteatomas are believed to arise from embryonal inclusions or rests of epithelial cells in the middle ear, mastoid, or petrous bone.  Applies only to cholesteatomas in patients with the following criteria: an intact tympanic membrane, no continuity with the external ear canal,  and lack of etiological factor, i.e.  tympanic membrane perforation, history of ear infections or Eustachian tube dysfunction.\nAcquired: 98%\n1.\tPrimary Acquired: most common type; arises from retraction of the superior pars flaccida (Prussak's space) of the tympanic membrane which results in the formation of an epithelial pocket.  \n2.\tSecondary Acquired:  due to chronic infection and perforation of the pars tensa which results in trapping of epithelial cells within the middle ear.  \n\nPathogenesis:  Several pathogenic mechanisms have been produced to explain the development of acquired cholesteatomas,  however, in all types the keratinizing squamous epithelium has spread beyond its normal location.\n\tThe pathogenesis of primary cholesteatoma is poorly understood.  \tIt is believed that infection/inflammation, TM or Eustachian tube dysfunction, leads to retraction of the tympanic membrane, usually in the region of the superior pars flaccida in Prussak's space.  This retraction results in an epithelial-lined pocket that becomes sealed and subsequently expands b/c of progressive accumulation of epithelial debris, extending posteriorly through the aditus and antrum to the mastoid air cells.  Extension also occurs along the posterior tympanic recesses and petrous apex.\n\tSecondary acquired cholesteatoma is believed to occur via implantation of squamous epithelium into the middle ear as a result of TM perforation (iatrogenic vs traumatic).  Another mechanism is via metaplasia of the cuboidal epithelium of the middle ear to keratinized stratified squamous epithelium due to chronic or recurrent otitis media.  \n\nPathophysiology:\n\tCholesteatomas enlarge with fairly typical patterns of growth.  The most common locations from which cholesteatoma arise are the posterior epitympanum, the posterior mesotympanum and the anterior epitympanum.  Cholesteatomas are channeled along characteristic pathways by surrounding mucosal folds, the middle ear ossicles, and their suspensory ligaments.    \n\tCholesteatomas may grow and cause  primarily bony erosion of the following:\n\t\tScutum\n\t\tOssicles\n\t\tMastoid air cells\n\t\tTegmen\n\t\tSigmoid sinus plate\n\t\tFacial nerve canal\n\t\tLateral semicircular canal wall\n\n\tExtensive disease may result in:  meningitis, abscess, venous sinus thrombosis, CSF rhinorrhea, labrynthine fistula.\n\tCholesteatoma in children is considered to be more aggressive than in the adult population.  Extensive disease is found more frequently in children compared to adults. Also, higher rates of residual and recurrent disease have been documented in the pediatric population.  However, the incidence of complications is directly related to the duration of disease, which is longer in adult patients.  Therefore, complication rates are higher in adults. \n Clinical Manifestations:  Most cholesteatomas are asymptomatic in their early development; children may come to medical attention with otorrhea and rarely complain of decreased hearing.  The most common presenting symptoms are hearing loss, otorrhea, otalgia, nasal obstruction, tinnitus and vertigo.  A previous history of middle ear disease, such as chronic otitis media and/or tympanic membrane perforation may be evident.  Progressive unilateral hearing loss with a chronic foul smelling otorrhea should  raise suspicion.\nPhysical exam: white mass behind the posterior half of the tympanic membrane, A retraction pocket may be seen, often in the attic or posterosuperior quadrant of the TM. facial nerve palsy, vertigo When extensive, a polyp may protrude through an attic defect.\n\nRadiologic Findings: Classic finding on CT is a soft tissue density in Prussak's space (superior recess of the TM) with subtle erosion of the scutum and neck of malleus and medial displacement of the remaining ossicles.\n\nCT: nondependent homogenous mass with well-or ill-defined borders; TM bulging with displacement of ossicles, +/- erosion of the scutum and ossicles; expansion of the attic.  Mastoid air cells are usually underpneumatized and sclerotic\n\t\n \t \nMR:  isoitense on T1 and moderate intensity on T2; enhancement of the otic capsule or facial nerve canal\n\nDx:  Usually made otoscopically; Computerized tomography may be used to delineate the extent of disease, check the aeration of the mastoid and to help rule out intratemporal and /or intracranial complications.  \n\nDDx: \n\tOtitis media\n\tCholesterol Granuloma\n\tCongenital Cholesteatoma\n\nTx:  Tympanomastoidectomy\n\tThe primary surgical goal is to removing disease while preserving anatomy.   Success rates of first surgery ranges from 40-80%, therefore, the need for a second procedure is fairly common.",

            "Disease Discussion": "A lung abscess is a collection of purulent material within a destroyed portion of the lung.  The incidence is much lower than earlier days, secondary to improved antibiotic coverage and earlier treatment.  \n\nThe most common bacteria to form a lung abscess are anaerobes, Staph aureus, gram-negatives (Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas,others).  Streptococcus pneumoniae/pyogenes and few others are less common.  Lung abscess formation usually involves the normal oral flora (nearly all cases involving anaerobics).  Staph and gram-negative infections are often nosocomial in origin.  \n\nPathogenesis usually involves aspiration as the mechanism to access the lung.  Periodontal disease often coexists.  Loss of consciousness/gag reflex (alcoholism, drug addiction, general anesthesia, seizure, sedatives, neurological d/o) and esophageal d/o's increase aspiration risk.  Also a nasogastric tube, tracheostomy, throat and dental surgeries increase the risk.\n\nInitially, there is an area of pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia that follows gravity.  Aspiration in the supine position more likely lead to pneumonia in the posterior segments of upper lobes or superior segments of lower lobes - often on the right.  Aspiration in the upright/semi-upright position leads to basal segmental lower lobe involvement.\n\nSymptoms of an abscess are similar to pneumonia with fever, malaise, cough, pleuritic chest pain and sputum production.  Anaerobic abscess often have a more indolent course.  Those caused by Staph or Gram-negatives often have a more fulminant course.  Typically it takes 7-14 days from aspiration to form an abscess cavity that is seen on CXR.",

            "Disease Discussion": "ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION (AVM)\n\nClinical Features:  AVMs are the most common symptomatic congenital vascular malformations.  The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related\u201d aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

It accounts for 30-60 of all choroid plexus tumors in children.  50% occur in the lateral ventricles.  The most common presentation is obstructive hydrocephalus (vomiting, vision changes, headache, balance problems, mental status changes).  \nOn CT, these lesions are seen arising from the choroid plexus and are often hyperdense on non-contrast images.  They have a grape-like or cauliflower appearance and avidly enhance.  They often cause ventricular obstruction.  Central necrosis and hemorrhage may occur.  The differential diagnosis includes choriod plexus pappiloma, medulloepithelioma (infants), teratoma, and metastasic adenocarcinoma (adults).   The 5-year survival is 40%.\nReferences\n1.  \"http://wiki.cns.org/wiki/index.php/Choroid_Plexus_Carcinoma\"  Site accessed on 02/07/08.

May be a congenital. Carcinomas usually seen only in pediatric age group.\n\nClinical Presentation: Hydrocephalus with headaches\n\nHistology: Papillomas have characteristic lobulated gross appearance. Most are well-differentiated and may resemble normal choroid plexus, however, anaplastic transformation may occur. Parenchymal invasion suggests carcinoma, but can be seen with benign tumors as well.\n\nTransformation of papilloma into carcinoma has been reported.\n\nSpecial Stains: Cytokeratin distinguishes CPP from ependymoma; Prealbumin (transthyretin) may be helpful (although choroid metastases may also stain positive)\nProgression: CSF seeding may occur in both papillomas and carcinomas.\n\nRadiology: Well-demarcated intraventricular (or cerebellopontine angle) mass with hydrocephalus. Calcification especially frequent in fourth ventricular tumors. In adult patients the fourth ventricle is more common. The tumor is attached to the choroid plexus.\n\nComments: Hydrocephalus may reflect multiple factors, including CSF over-production, ventricular obstruction, and impaired CSF reabsorption. Can present as a congenital brain tumor or neoplasm.\n\n===================================================\n[REF 1]\n\"Choroid plexus tumours are rare epithelial brain tumours and limited information is available regarding their biology and the best treatment. A meta-analysis was done to determine prognostic factors and the influence of various treatment modalities. A thorough review of the medical literature (1966-1998) revealed 566 well-documented choroid plexus tumours. These were entered into a  database, which was analysed to determine prognostic factors and treatment modalities. Most patients with a supratentorial tumour\n were children, while the most common sites in adults were the fourth ventricle and the cerebellar pontine angle. Cerebellar pontine angle tumours were more frequently benign. Histology was the most important prognostic factor, as one, five, and 10-year projected survival rates were 90, 81, and 77% in choroid plexus-papilloma (n=353) compared to only 71, 41, and 35% in choroid plexus-carcinoma respectively (P<0.0005). Surgery was prognostically relevant for both choroid plexus-papilloma (P=0.0005) and choroid plexus-carcinoma (P=0.0001). Radiotherapy was associated with significantly better survival in choroid plexus-carcinomas.\n\nEight of 22 documented choroid plexus-carcinomas responded to chemotherapy. Relapse after primary treatment was a poor prognostic factor in choroid plexus-carcinoma patients but not in choroid plexus-papilloma patients. Treatment of choroid plexus tumours should start with radical surgical resection. This should be followed by adjuvant treatment in case of choroid plexus-carcinoma, and a \"wait and see\" approach in choroid plexus-papilloma. Copyright 2002 Cancer Research UK\"",

This tendency frequently results in bullets seen on radiographs pointing toward their direction of travel and entrance wound.\n\n\nThis case demonstrates an unusual path bringing up another unintuitive situation called bullet embolism, which is a rare but well documented phenomenon.  With bullet embolism, the bullet travels through vascular channels; however, in our patient, the bullet traveled through both an air-filled channel (the external auditory canal) and a vascular channel (the petrous carotid canal). Although this case does not represent bullet embolism by definition, its unusual path brings up another reason to use the even number rule (see factoid)."

            "Disease Discussion": "In ballistic trauma it is important to account for all bullets, whether lodged in the patient\u2019s body or exited through a wound.  The even # rule, as discussed below, is a useful tool to quickly account for all foreign bodies that have entered a patient.  Even # rule deviation should prompt the physician to initiate further investigation to locate the discordant bullet(s) or come up with another explanation (i.e. shared exit wound).\n\nEVEN # RULE\n\u2022  Entrance + exit + bullet = even # (all bullets accounted for)\n  Any of the following may occur:\n  \u2013 all bullets exited\n  \u2013 all bullets lodged in body tissue\n  \u2013 all bullets exited or lodged in body tissue\n\n\u2022  If entrance + exit + bullet = an odd # then not all bullets are accounted for, hence further imaging or explanation necessary\n\n  \u2013 shared exit wound\n  \u2013 bullet embolization\n\nBULLET EMBOLISM\nBullet embolism is a rare complication of vascular trauma.  When a firearm missile enters a vascular structure, the projectile can pass through both walls of the vessel or settle within the wall or lumen.  If the latter occurs, the missile may be carried by the flow of blood to a new site resulting in an embolism (1,2,3).\nSymptomatic arterial emboli may result in peripheral ischemia and should be removed quickly to avoid tissue or neurologic damage.  Asymptomatic, cerebral, pulmonary, and pelvic arterial emboli may remain in place, especially if removal is technically difficult (3).  Possible adverse effects of this decision, however, may lead to further embolization or migration, thrombosis, potential delayed arterial insufficiency, and subsequent pseudoaneurysm. \n\nThe Lodox Statscan\u2122 (see related links) allows for total body imaging in a short period of time for quantifying multiple projectiles.",

The majority (~95%) of the peritoneal material is acellular mucin, which is produced by the neoplastic cells implanted within the peritoneal cavity. \n\nFindings on CT include loculated ascites with scalloping of the abdominal organs and septations - with or without calcification. The Peritoneal surface may also contain punctate calcifications. The mucinous ascities is usually loculated, and a key finding is mass effect on the solid viscera, such as scalloping of the liver and displacement of hollow viscera (bowel). This is in contrast to typical non-neoplastic ascites, which will surround organs, but may not alter their normal contours.\n\nAlthough the primary process may be benign or malignant, some authorities believe the unrelenting diffuse form is only from malignant disease.\n\nTreatment often consists of removal of the primary tumor, omentectomy, and debulking of the mucoid material but recurrences are common. There is progressive distention of the peritoneum and compression of abdominal viscera. Repeated surgical debridement of mucoid material from the abdomen carries the risks of surgical complications, which is often the eventual cause of death.

There are many types of gastric bezoars.  The most common is composed of fibrous plant matter.  These are called phytobezoars, and are usually assymptomatic.  Trichobezoars are composed of hair, and are less common, but can be larger.  Bezoars are generally asymptomatic, but occasionally may produce gastric outlet obstruction, or in the case of trichobezoars can be abrasive, causing mucosal ulcerations.  Bezoars of all types can produce early satiety.  Patients who have had gastric surgery or delayed gastric emptying are at increased risk of developing all types of bezoars.\n\nWest WM, Duncan ND.

            "Disease Discussion": "Neoplasm : Bronchogenic carcinoma of the lung\n\nSynonyms: Lung cancer\n\nCell of Origin: Non-small cell carcinoma\n\nGenetics and Associations: Cigarette smoking (total pack years) is the most significant risk factor. Other associations include radiation exposure, asbestos exposure, occupational inhaled substances (especially nickel, chromates, and arsenic), genetically dominant oncogenes, and loss of tumor suppressor genes.\n\nDemographics (Age, Sex, Incidence): Cancer of the lung occurs most often between the ages of 40 and 70, with a peak incidence in the 6th or 7th decade. It is the leading cause of cancer deaths in both sexes and the male:female death ratio is about 3:1. The annual death rate for lung cancer is about 70/100,000 for males and 19/100,000 for females.\n\nCommon Locations: Bronchogenic cancers arise most often as a hilar mass but may also present as a large peripheral mass.\n\nGross Appearance: The neoplastic tissue is typically gray-white and firm to hard.  Bulky tumors often have areas of necrosis that appear yellow-white and mottling. \n\nHistology: Histology varies depending on the subtype: adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype and features include gland formation, mucin production, and often an adjacent desmoplastic response.  Other subtypes include squamous cell carcinomas, small cell carcinomas, and large cell carcinomas.\n\nSpecial Stains: Mucicarmine, Cytokeratin 7, Cytokeratin 20, and TTF -1.\n\nRadiology: Plain chest films may show single or multiple nodules, well defined or poorly defined masses in the hilar or peripheral regions or no findings. Mediastinal enlargement may be evident due to primary tumor or metastatic lymphadenopathy.  CT may show an irregular or spiculated edge due to fibrosis surrounding the tumor, a lobulated contour, air bronchograms within the nodule, or cavitation. 95% of lung nodules exceeding 2 cm are cancers. \nOf particular significance for this case is the radiologic appearance of lung cancer metastases to the liver. A liver met will typically appear as a well-defined, low-density, solid mass with vague peripheral enhancement.  The mass will often appear hypodense centrally due to tumor necrosis.  Calcifications may be present. Multiple masses or diffusely infiltrating metastases may also occur.   \n\nProgression: Bronchogenic CA spreads by direct invasion or via the hematogeneous or lympahngitic routes.  Mediastinal nodes are commonly involved, and distal mets to the liver, brain, bone, and adrenals are common.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: Overall prognosis is approximately 9% 5 year survival. Small-cell carcinoma has a median survival rate of 12-18 months and is treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Non-small cell cancers are treated surgically if disease is limited. Chemotherapy and radiation may be used in advanced disease.",

Aggressive periosteal response manifests as an onion-skin or \u2018sunburst\u2019 appearance.  The overall disease-free 5-year survival in patients presenting with nonmetastatitic disease is 54-95% for Ewing sarcoma (3). Prognosis is worse for larger central lesions (e.g.retroperitoneal) as compared to distal ones with the best prognosis with periosteal or subperiosteal tumors.

Fatigue type fractures result from the application of unusual force/torque onto a normal bone, this is common among athletes (especially long distance runners or ballet dancers) or in military members (especially recruits in basic training or undergoing parachute training).  Insufficiency type fractures results from the application of normal stress on an abnormal bone.  The underlying abnormality of the bone arises from a diverse array of causes, including osteoporosis, Paget's disease, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, fibrous dysplasia, irradiation, and so forth.    \n\nClinically the patient complains of activity-related pain that is relieved by rest.  There also may be a localized soft tissue swelling or tenderness, though the specific site and activity being engaged in influences these variables.\n\nThe most common site of fatigue-type stress fractues is the metatarsals (march fracture) with the second most frequent location being the calcaneus.  These calcaneal stress fractures are usually found with a vertical or oblique orientation in the posterior or posterosuperior portion of calcaneus.

            "Discussion": "This 51-year-old female who had back pain and the radiographs and CT showed significant levoscoliosis and grade 2 anterior spondylolisthesis at L4/L5 with degenerative changes secondary to apophyseal joint disease.  It is difficult to determine definitively the grade of displacement on the radiograph due to the rotatory component. ACR Codes: 4.9\nThe term spondylolisthesis originated in the 18th century. In 1882, Franz Ludwig Neubebauer described spondylolisthesis in women who had died during labor due to difficulties resulting from narrow birth canals. The word is of Greek origin, spondylo meaning spine and listhesis meaning slippage or slip. \nSpondylolisthesis is defined as a displacement of a superior vertebra in relation to the inferior one. The most common type of spondylolisthesis occurs due to fracture of the pars interarticularis, with L5/S1 being the most frequent level. A grading system that is commonly used describes a grade 1 as displacement of 25% or less of the involved vertebra, grade 2 is displacement greater than 25% and up to 50%, grade 3 is displacement greater than 50% and up to 75% and grade 4 is greater than 75% displacement and up to 100% displacement. \nBecause spondylolisthesis typically occurs at levels below the spinal cord, the condition is rarely fatal. However, besides low back pain, nerve root involvement is common, especially because of compression from the inferior articular process. Other common presentations besides musculoskeletal pain and radiculopathy are related to degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis when present. \nAs mentioned previously, there are different etiologies of spondylolisthesis. The most common, occurring nearly 80% of the time, is type II, or spondylolytic spondylolisthesis (also known as isthmic). This commonly follows spondylolysis, often as a result of athletic activity (common athletics include diving, gymnastics, and wrestling). Type I is congenital, or dysplastic, and is a defect involving the facet joint that allows displacement. Type III is due to degenerative changes and is common in older patients. Type IV is traumatic and can be included in Type 2, but also includes trauma that causes displacement but that does not involve the pars interarticularis. Lastly, type V is pathologic spondylolisthesis, such as displacement following a fracture due to a neoplasm. \nLateral radiographs are often excellent for diagnosing and grading sponylolisthesis, especially when the displacement is anterior/posterior. Oblique views are also helpful to view the pars interarticularis, which is often described as a \u201cScotty dog\u201d (the eye is the pedicle, the ear is the superior articular process, and a fracture of the par interarticularis is described as the collar and appears as a lucency). CT imaging is often used to confirm the diagnosis as well as to better define bony defects, whether it be a fracture of the pars interarticularis, fractures elsewhere allowing displacement, or other bony anomalies. MR imaging is used to image soft tissue, such as nerve root involvement, spinal stenosis, and disc disorders. \nSpondylolisthesis is common; 5% of adults have a degree of displacement. Spondylolysis involvement is twice as common in men compared to women, and etiologies such as dysplastic and degenerative are more common in women. Eskimos have an incidence as high as 50% in adults for reasons unknown. \nTreatments are typically performed by orthopedic surgeons or neurosurgeons when symptoms and disability are determined severe enough. Treatment includes fixation with hardware and fusion of the involved vertebra. There are no interventional radiological treatments yet."

            "Discussion": "Horseshoe kidney is a relatively common renal anomaly, occuring in 1 in 400 births. It is more common in males, 2 to 1.  The abnormality is thought to occur because of an abnormal position of the umbilical artery which inhibits normal cephalad migration of the fetal kidneys. The metanephric blastema is pushed together and fuses, usually at the lower pole.  \n\nThe central isthmus can either contain parenchymal tissue or it can be a simply fibrous band.  The parenchymal isthmus is more common.  The isthmus is normally anterior to the aorta and IVC, but posterior to the inferior mesenteric artery.  \n\nPatients with horseshoe kidney can remain assymptomatic throughout their lives.  However patients with horseshoe kidney are at increased risk for developing a variety of abnormalities including:\n- ureteropelvic junction obstruction (30%).\n- infection.\n- renal calculus.\n- carcinoma.\n- increased risk from traumatic injury especially when the isthmus has normal paranchyma."

            "Title": "Superior Vena Cava Syndrome",
            "Disease Discussion": "Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome occurs when there is compression of the SVC vessel wall that results in obstruction of blood flow returning to the heart. Common symptoms include dyspnea, jugular venous distention, and edema of the face and upper extremities. The most common cause is malignancy. In cases of SVC syndrome secondary to malignancy, 90% are caused by either bronchogenic carcinoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Around 2-4% of all lung cancer patients will develop SVC syndrome at some point during their disease course. While Hodgkin's lymphoma is known for mediastinal lymphadenopathy, it rarely causes SVC syndrome.\n\nThere are multiple other non-malignant etiologies. Patients with indwelling intravascular catheters can develop thrombosis resulting in obstruction of the vessel. Fibrosing mediastinitis can result in an excessive fibrotic reaction in the mediastinum that can affect multiple structures within this compartment, to include the SVC. Excessive radiation can cause a similar response, with fibrosis of the vessels resulting in SVC syndrome. \n\nThe severity of symptoms can vary based on the rate of occlusion. A rapid SVC occlusion may not allow enough time for systemic compensation with collateral vein formation, thus increasing the severity of symptoms. \n\nPrognosis and treatment varies greatly but is often based on the etiology of disease.  Benign causes of SVC syndrome that can resolve completely if the underlying benign disease is treated. In other cases, such as advanced malignancy, the goal of therapy is palliation, such as use of radiation therapy or vascular stent placement. In general, surgical care is not the best option. \n\nAs most cases of SVC syndrome are due to malignancy, a key question is how advanced the disease as progressed.  If tumor is infiltrating the SVC (and mediastinum), resection will not provide a cure.  In cases of advanced malignancy, the goal of therapy is palliation, such as use of radiation therapyto shrink tumor burden or vascular stent placement for symptom relief. In general, surgical care is not the best option in these cases.   Steroids have been used for temporary relief of symptoms, but chronic steroid use can cause systemic fluid retention, which often exacerbates this condition.",

Pituitary function is usually normal, but occasionally the PRL level is increased and GH reserve is reduced.\n\nSecondary empty sella syndrome is observed in patients with otherwise benign cerebrospinal fluid hypertension and in patients with a loss of pituitary function from apoplexy or surgical therapy. Abnormal GH, PRL, or ACTH secretion may persist in such patients.\n\nThe diagnosis is confirmed with MRI or CT.

A secondary bacterial infection may ensue. \n     Diagnosis is most often made with a right upper quadrant ultrasound, and can be confirmed with a nuclear medicine hepatobiliary scan. Diffuse gallbladder wall thickening (>3mm), pericholecystic fluid and  gallstones all in the presence of a sonographic Murphy's sign is virtually diagnostic for acute cholecystitis.  Diagnosis with computed tomography is most of the time incidentally made when the CT is ordered looking for other causes of abdominal pain. With CT the diagnosis is suggested when gallbladder distention, visible stones (rarely visible), cystic duct dilatation, contrast enhancement of the gall bladder wall, and edema or abscess in surrounding tissues is observed.\n     Treatment is  cholecystectomy and/or medical management.  Many patients are managed medically with bowel rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics, when indicated.  Surgery is reserved for urgent cases or elective resections after cholecystitis.\n     Because cholecystectomy in the emergency setting can be associated with 4%-7% mortality, an alternative treatment is percutaneous cholecystostomy with a pigtailcatheter in order to continuously drain bile from the gall bladder.",

            "Disease Discussion": "VACTERL syndrome presents as an array of findings involving various systems: Vertebral/Vascular, Anal/Auricular, Cardiac, TracheoEsophageal, Renal/Radial, and Limb/Liver.  At least three of these systems (72% of patients) must be involved for the diagnosis of VACTERL to be made (although 8% of patients with the syndrome have at least 5 abnormalities).  This syndrome should be suspected if a pediatric patient is found to have the combination of vertebral plus one other associated anomaly during infantile years. Since the findings span throughout the body, a wide modality of radiographic techniques may be used to make the diagnosis.\n\nCertain organ systems and their abnormalities arise more often than others and are listed in order of prevalence: Cardiac, Renal, Anal, Radial, Tracheoesophageal, Vertebral.  The most common combination of abnormalities are as follows:\n3 abnormalities: Cardiac-renal-limb or Cardiac-Anal-Renal \n5 abnormalities:  Cardiac-Anal-TEF-Renal-Limb.\n\nThe MC abnormalities in each organ system (and often seen on imaging) are as follows:\n\nVertebral: Hemi/cleft vertebrae, kyphosis/scoliosis, caudal regression, Branchial Arch/Cleft Abnormalities\n\nCardiac: VSD (30%), PDA, ASD\n\nTracheoEsophageal: TEF (25% TEF pts have VACTERL), Esophageal Atresia, Tracheal Atresia, Horseshoe Lung, Ectopic Bronchus\n\nRenal/ GU: Renal Agenesis, Horseshoe Kidney, Cryptoorchidism, Vaginal Atresia\n\nLimb: Radial ray abnormalities, Absent / Hypoplastic Extremity Bones/Vessels, Polydactyly\n\n\nRISK FACTORS / EPIDEMIOLOGY\n\nVACTERL syndrome has been associated with maternal diabetes and prenatal lead exposure causing abnormal mesodermal development before 35 days of gestation. \n\nVACTERL synrome has also been linked to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and down-regulation of the cholesterol-dependent sonic-hedgehog morphogenic pathway.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:\n\nPHAVER syndrome:  Limb Pterygia, Congenital Heart, Vertebral Defects, Ear Anomalies,Radial Defects\n\nTrisomy 13 (Patau Syndrome): Cranial/Brain Defects, Microopthalmia, Polydactyly \n\nTrisomy 18 (Edwards Syndrome): Clenched Fist, Microcephaly, Micrognathia, Rocker-Bottom Feet\n\nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS:\n\nHolt-Oram Syndrome\nPseudothalidomide Syndrome\nJarcho-Levin Syndrome\n\n \n\nIMAGING\n\nVarious imaging modalities may be used but are not limited to the following:\n\n-Prenatal Ultrasound: Polyhydramnios may suggest possible TEF. Oligohydramnios may suggest renal abnormalities.\n\n-Angiography:  For diagnosis of radial artery hypoplasia or cardiac abnormalities.\n\n-Plain Films, CT, and MRI can aid in diagnosis of core organ system and musculoskeletal abnormalities. \n\n \n\nPROGNOSIS / TREATMENT\n\nMortality is 12% intrapartum, 28% during the neonatal period, and 48% during the first year of life. 1/3 of all patients with VACTERL are born prematurely.  If VACTERL syndrome is suspected on prenatal ultrasound, it is suggested that the fetus be delivered at a tertiary care facility to ensure best postpartum care for the baby.",

The reasons for such an increase are unknown. (1)  There are three classifications of this type of cancer:  Type I mainly involves the distal esophagus, Type II is primarily located at the GE junction, and Type II mainly involves the subcardial/proximal stomach region. (3)  GE junction adenocarcinoma can either arise from the esophagus or proximal gastric area.  It is very difficult to determine the primary cancer site. (1) Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma include familial adenomatous polyposis, gastric adenomas/ dysplasia,  chronic atrophic gastritis,  gastric metaplasia, diet high in nitrates, and Helicobacter pylori infection.  Risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma include smoking, obesity, and Barrett\u2019s esophagus- patients affected with Barrett\u2019s esophagus have a 30-40% higher chance of developing cancer. (4)  \n\nRadiological evaluation of GE adenocarcinoma should be able to determine tumor spread and response to chemotherapy.  The sensitivity of CT for detection of distant metastases ranges between 50% to 90%.  Of those shown to have only local disease with CT, FDG-PET detected metastatic disease in approximately 20% more cases. In addition, esophageal ultrasound (EUS) can differentiate between stages T1/T2 and stages T3/T4 with an accuracy > 90%.  Assessment of tumor response to chemotherapy by FDG-PET correlates with tumor regression proven by histology and can predict patient outcome as early as 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. (5)",

            "Title": "LEFT LOWER LOBE COLLAPSE",
            "Disease Discussion": "Lower lobe collapse may involve the whole lobe, however the superior segment is frequently spared.  With collapse the major fissure rotates posterior and medially and the upper half of the fissure deviates inferiorly.  Consequently the collapsed lobe lies posteromedially in the thoracic cavity adjacent to the diaphragm and mediastinum. If the inferior pulmonary ligament does not attach to the diaphragm, the lobe is positioned against the mediastinum with little if any contact with the diaphragm.  \n\nFrontal radiographs frequently demonstrate left retrocardiac triangular density.  If the superior segment remains aerated, the upper half of the major fissure is commonly seen as a horizontal line contacting the spine on frontal radiographs.  In such cases the major fissure may be confused with the minor fissure, however this can be avoided by recalling that the minor fissure does not cross medial to the hilum.\n\nOn the lateral view mild partial volume loss may be difficult to recognize.  With more significant volume loss, however, there is an ill-defined triangular opacity in the lower posterior quadrant of the chest, often with loss of the outline of the posterior half of the diaphragm.  With very severe collapse the posterior half of the hemidiaphragm may become visible secondary to compensatory expansion of the upper and middle lobes, which contact the previously effaced diaphragm.  In contrast to normal, in lower lobe collapse the lower vertebrae appear denser than those located more superiorly.  Posterior displacement of the main bronchus can also be recognized on lateral radiographs in lower lobe collapse, however is subtle and requires confident knowledge of the normal.\n\nThe distal lobar and segmental divisions of the pulmonary artery are invisible with severe lower lobe collapse because they course through an opaque lobe.  In such cases one must be careful not to mistake displaced middle and upper lobe trunks as lower lobe arteries.  \n\nThe outline of the top of the aortic knob may be obliterated in severe left lower lobe collapse.  The flat waist sign may also occur with severe collapse and is secondary to leftward displacement and rotation of the heart.  This is seen as flattening of the contours of the aortic knob and adjacent pulmonary artery.",

            "Discussion": "A majority of non-endocrine pancreatic carcinomas, up to 75-85%, are ductal cell adenocarcinomas[1,2]. The tumor is highly lethal and is usually unresectable at presentation. The average survival time of a patient with this disease is only 8 months or less. These tumors usually occur in the seventh decade of life.  \n\nCurrently, computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used imaging method in the assessment of pancreatic tumors. The sensitivity of CT detection of pancreatic tumors is reported to be more than 90% when direct or indirect signs are used for diagnosis[1]. However, the potential to differentiate exocrine (non-endocrine) tumors of the pancreas is limited. \n\nOn non-enhanced CT imaging, there is often a slightly decreased attenuating pancreatic mass seen. Following rapid bolus of contrast injection, the tumor usually appears as a hypodense mass with ill-defined borders. Calcification is almost never present within the mass. Indirect signs of a pancreatic mass include abrupt obstruction of the common bile and/or pancreatic duct and atrophy of pancreatic tissue beyond the tumor. The typical distribution of ductal cell adenocarcinoma is as follows: 60\u201370% at the pancreatic head, 10% the body, 5% the tail, 5% both head and body, and about 10% body and tail [1]. \n\nThose who present with a pancreatic head mass often have symptoms earlier than in those with pancreatic tail masses, mainly due to symptomatic obstruction of the biliary or pancreatic duct. Radiographic assessment of resectability is critical because surgical resection offers the only hope of cure[2].  However, the surgery itself carries a high morbidity. Resectable patients may live 1-2 years. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilation of the bile or pancreatic ducts or combined dilation of both the bile and pancreatic ducts without an identifiable pancreatic head mass."

Because of this location, classic signs include obstructive jaundice (secondary to common bile duct obstruction) and Courvoisier's sign (an enlarged nontender palpable gall bladder). Weight loss and/or back pain are also presentations for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are lethal tumors, usually unresectable at presentation with average survival time estimated to be 5-8 months. \n\nRadiographic assessment of resectability is critical because surgical resection offers the only hope of cure. Thin-slice contrast-enhanced CT is generally more sensitive than ultrasound for radiographic characterization. Tumors appear hypodense on CT. Other pertinent associated CT findings include obstruction of the common bile and pancreatic ducts, pancreatic atrophy beyond the tumor, and regional spread (nodes, liver, peritoneal cavity). Signs of resectability include isolated pancreatic mass (+/- ductal dilitation) or no identifiable pancreatic mass but combined ductal dilitation. Signs of unresectability include tumor extension beyond pancreas. Only 10-15% of patients have potentially resectable tumors. \n\nMRCP and ERCP are adjunctive modalities for selectively imaging the pancreatic duct and biliary tree. Specifically, ERCP is important in obtaining tissue and/or in performing palliative interventions (i.e. stent placements for decompression).",

The average age of onset is in the adult between the ages of 40- 60 with a greater predisposition for men.  The distribution is more common in the flat bones, especially the shoulder and pelvis.  The presentation is most commonly of the exostotic type, as a large calcified mass in a vertebral body developing into the paraspinal tissue.  The center of the tumor is often calcified with stippling and mottling with underlying bone distruction with a thick cap of sarcomatous cartilage surrounding the calcified mass. The causes include de novo appearance, malignant transformation of an enchondroma, or development from the cartilaginous cap of an osteochondroma.  The clinical hx is often one of an indolent pain, swelling, with a progressive increase in size to the point of compression of neighboring organs, nerve root, or spinal cord compression.  The cartilage emits a high T2 signal on MRI.  Treatment is radical surgical resection due to the fact that the tumor is very refractory to chemotherapy.   Incidently, most tumors are discovered late in presentation forcing a piecemeal resection and increased recurrence post-op.  The dedifferentiated chondrosarcoma a low-grade tumor often transforms into osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma and becomes responsive to chemotherapy.  Prognosis is that a low-grade lesion has a 90% 10-year survival, while high-grade have 20-40% 10-year survival. Follow-up with plain films to screen for recurrence.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The response of normal pericardium to injury is cellular proliferation and/or the production of fluid (pericardial effusion).  Inflammation of the pericardium (i.e. pericarditis) can be the result of many different etiologies.  The most common of these etiologies include infectious (viral, bacterial, fungal and TB), post-MI, association with malignancy (breast, lung, lymphoproliferative and melanoma), association with systemic disease (uremia, hypothyroidism and connective tissue disorders) and post-chest radiation exposure (Primack 1998). \n\nThe most common result of acute pericarditis is the formation of a pericardial effusion, which can be transudative or exudative depending on the underlying pathology.  Clinical signs of effusion include pericardial friction rub, chest pain, increased dullness over precordium and pulsus paradoxus.  Plain film diagnosis of pericardial disease is based on the observation of the changes in the contours of the heart borders contained by the pericardium (Rozenshtein 1999).  Radiographic signs of pericardial effusion include a smooth generalized increase in size of the cardiac silhouette without specific chamber enlargement, \"water-bottle\" or \"globular\" cardiac configuration and an anterior pericardial stripe thicker than 2 mm in the lateral view (Rozenshtein 1999).  \n\nPericardial effusion can progress to the point where diastolic filling of the ventricles is severely impeded and the patient becomes hemodynamically unstable.  This condition is termed cardiac tamponade and is heralded clinically by Beck's triad, which includes muffled heart sounds, distended neck veins and hypotension.  Pulsus paradoxus is another clinical sign frequently seen in tamponade.  Because acute tamponade is possible with small effusions, plain films are not a sensitive technique for detecting clinically significant pericardial enlargement.  Subtle changes in cardiac contour may only be evident through comparison to prior films.  If there is cardiac enlargement with decreased pulmonary vasculature or if the azygous and SVC are dilated, one should have a high index of suspicion for tamponade (Rozenshtein 1999).",

The reasons for such an increase are unknown. (1)  There are three classifications of this type of cancer:  Type I mainly involves the distal esophagus, Type II is primarily located at the GE junction, and Type II mainly involves the subcardial/proximal stomach region. (3)  GE junction adenocarcinoma can either arise from the esophagus or proximal gastric area.  It is very difficult to determine the primary cancer site. (1) Risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma include familial adenomatous polyposis, gastric adenomas/ dysplasia,  chronic atrophic gastritis,  gastric metaplasia, diet high in nitrates, and Helicobacter pylori infection.  Risk factors for esophageal adenocarcinoma include smoking, obesity, and Barrett\u2019s esophagus- patients affected with Barrett\u2019s esophagus have a 30-40% higher chance of developing cancer. (4)  \n\nRadiological evaluation of GE adenocarcinoma should be able to determine tumor spread and response to chemotherapy.  The sensitivity of CT for detection of distant metastases ranges between 50% to 90%.  Of those shown to have only local disease with CT, FDG-PET detected metastatic disease in approximately 20% more cases. In addition, esophageal ultrasound (EUS) can differentiate between stages T1/T2 and stages T3/T4 with an accuracy > 90%.  Assessment of tumor response to chemotherapy by FDG-PET correlates with tumor regression proven by histology and can predict patient outcome as early as 2 weeks after initiation of therapy. (5)",

Complications include venous infarcts, intracerebral hemorrhage and intracranial hypertension.\n\nOn noncontrast CT, the thombosed sinus is usually hyperdense.  This is nonspecific as dehydrated patients, adjacent subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage or elevated hematocrit can cause increased sinus attenuation.  On contrast enhanced CT, the empty delta sign is a central defect from thrombus surrounded by contrast enhanced blood.  On MRI, absence of a flow void or abnormal signal within the sinus is seen. \n\nMR venography with two-dimensional time-of-flight is used due to high sensitivity for slow flow compared to 3D TOF.

This CT appearance was described by Kuhlman et al(1) in patients with invasive aspergillosis. In severely neutropenic patients, the CT halo sign is highly suggestive of infection by an angioinvasive fungus, most commonly Aspergillus. Vascular invasion by this fungus results in thrombosis of small- to medium-sized vessels, which causes ischemic necrosis. At pathologic examination, the nodules represent foci of infarction, and the halo of ground-glass attenuation results from alveolar hemorrhage. Although it is less common, the halo sign may also be observed in nonhemorrhagic nodules, in which case either tumor cells or inflammatory infiltrate account for the halo of ground-glass attenuation. Nonetheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, the halo sign is considered early evidence of pulmonary aspergillosis even before serologic tests become positive, and it warrants the administration of systemic antifungal therapy(2).\n\nEarly recognition of this complication is critical because this disease is associated with a high mortality rate that ranges from 50% to 90%.  The frequency of the halo sign in patients with invasive aspergillosis is relatively high in the early stages of the disease, but alters with time and becomes progressively less frequent. In a group of 25 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis studied by using serial CT scans, the frequency of this sign ranged from 96% at day 0 to 19% at day 14(1).",

The sigmoid colon is most commonly affected, and most women who develop a sigmoidovaginal fistula have a history of a hysterectomy.  Other causes included neoplasms, inflammatory bowel disease, radiation, infection, and trauma.  \n\nRectovaginal fistulas represent a small portion of all anorectal fistulas, and are frequently secondary to obstetric complications, perineal infections, neoplasms such as colorectal adenocarcinoma or cervical cancer, radiation, trauma, and inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis).  Diverticular disease, which is typically absent in the rectum, is not a factor.  \n\nPatients with colovaginal fistulas may present with feces, flatus, or mucus discharge from the vagina.  Anal incontinence may also be present secondary to anal sphincter compromise.  \n\nAlthough the clinical symptoms, particularly the passage of feces through the vagina, indicate the presence of a fistula, its detection is often difficult unless a large communication is present. Vaginography and barium enema in conjunction with physical examination have traditionally been used for diagnosis.  CT, MR imaging, and endorectal US are alternative imaging modalities.\n\nColovaginal fistulas are managed surgically, by takedown of the fistula with colon resection and primary anastomosis.

            "Disease Discussion": "ARTERIOVENOUS MALFORMATION (AVM)\n\nClinical Features:  AVMs are the most common symptomatic congenital vascular malformations.  The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related\u201d aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

Pseudocysts that are greater than 5 cm in diameter and that persist for longer than 6 weeks should be considered for drainage. Recent natural history studies have suggested that noninterventional, expectant management is the best course in selected patients with minimal symptoms and no evidence of active alcohol use in whom the pseudocyst appears mature by radiography and does not resemble a cystic neoplasm. A significant number of these pseudocysts resolve spontaneously more than 6 weeks after their formation. Also, these studies demonstrate that large pseudocyst size is not an absolute indication for interventional therapy and that many peripancreatic fluid collections detected on CT in cases of acute pancreatitis resolve spontaneously. In patients who are stable and free of complications, and in whom serial ultrasound studies show that the pseudocyst is shrinking, conservative therapy is indicated. Conversely, if the pseudocyst is expanding and is complicated by rupture, hemorrhage, or abscess, the patient should be operated on. With ultrasound or CT guidance, sterile chronic pseudocysts can be treated safely with single or repeated needle aspiration or more prolonged catheter drainage with a success rate of 45 to 75%. The success rate of these techniques for infected pseudocysts is considerably less (40 to 50%). Patients who do not respond to drainage require surgical therapy for internal or external drainage of the cyst.",
            "Discussion": "On CT, pseudocysts are round or oval in shape, and have a relatively thin (1-2mm) symmetrical capsule and a fluidly content of <15 HU. They can vary significantly in size. Their circumferential capsule can later calcify, and they can dissect fascial planes traveling sometimes at great distances from the mediastinum to the lower pelvis. The detection of a cystic lesion with an even thick capsule containing peripheral or lumenal soft tissue nodules or septations is less consistent with a pseudocyst and more indicative of a neoplastic process with associated necrosis. When the attenuation values of the pseudocyst are slightly elevated, associated necrotic tissue or secondary infection should be suspected. Higher attenuation values of >40 to 50 HU are indicative of intracystic hemorrhage."

            "Title": "Pancreatic Pseudocyst",
            "Disease Discussion": "Pancreatic pseudocysts are non-epithelial lined cystic fluid collections that arise from disruption of a pancreatic duct, with leakage of amylase-rich pancreatic juice into the surrounding peripancreatic tissues. Pancreatic pseudocysts are one of four cystic lesions of the pancreas but accounts for 75% of all pancreatic cysts. The other three lesions include 1) benign and malignant cystic neoplasms (10%), 2) congenital cysts (5%), and 3) retention cysts (10%). Although pancreatic pseudocysts are the most common cystic lesion, neoplastic cysts must always be considered, particularly when contemplating nonsurgical treatment of a pancreatic cyst, since no diagnostic test or method is definitive or sensitive enough to distinguish the two.\n\n-Etiology and Pathogenesis: \nPseudocysts form after rupture of a pancreatic duct with extravasation of amylase-rich fluid and failure of reabsorption of this secretion. The extravasated fluid forms an encapsulated collection that is bound by surrounding viscera, that is, the stomach, spleen, liver, and transverse mesocolon. The fluid collections initially communicate with the ruptured pancreatic duct. Endoscopic studies have shown that pancreatic pseudocysts communicate with the pancreatic duct in 80% of cases. Pseudocysts are preceded by pancreatitis in 90% of cases and by trauma in 10%. Approximately 85% are located in the body or tail of the pancreas and 15% in the head. Some patients have two or more pseudocysts. Abdominal pain, with or without radiation to the back, is the usual presenting complaint. A palpable, tender mass may be found in the middle or left upper abdomen. The serum amylase level is elevated in 75% of patients at some point during their illness and may fluctuate markedly\n\n-Epidemiology: \nAxial imaging in acute pancreatitis has demonstrated peripancreatic fluid collections in as many as 80% of studies. Pseudocysts occur less frequently than do acute fluid collections and require more time to form with prevalence ranging from 5% to 70% depending on the severity of the attack and the depth of investigation. There is no gender preference. \n\n-Clinical Manifestations:  \nPseudocysts usually require at least 4 or more weeks to evolve, following an episode of acute pancreatitis. However, the natural history and clinical relevance of pancreatic pseudocysts have been challenging due to lack of unified methods of dectection. Cysts have indeterminate age and most are stable on follow-up examinations. Symptomatic cysts may manifest as persistent abdominal pain with or without radiating to back, abdominal mass, gastric outlet obstruction, and biliary obstruction. Infection is suspected in septic patients and, unless air bubbles produced gas-forming bacteria are present, the diagnosis should be confirmed with FNA. A pseudocyst that does not resolve spontaneously may lead to serious complications, such as (1) pain caused by expansion of the lesion and pressure on other viscera, (2) rupture, (3) hemorrhage, and (4) abscess. Rupture of a pancreatic pseudocyst is a particularly serious complication. Shock almost always supervenes. Mortality rates range from 14%, if the rupture is not associated with hemorrhage, to over 60% if hemorrhage has occurred. Rupture and hemorrhage are the prime causes of death from pancreatic pseudocyst. A triad of findings: (1) increase in the size of the mass, (2) a localized bruit over the mass, and (3) a sudden decrease in hemoglobin level and hematocrit without obvious external blood loss, should alert one to the possibility of hemorrhage from a pseudocyst.\n\n-Treatment:   \nIn studies with sonography, pseudocysts were seen to resolve in 25 to 40% of patients. Pseudocysts that are greater than 5 cm in diameter and that persist for longer than 6 weeks should be considered for drainage.

An ASD or VSD is usually seen in association. \n\nIn congentially corrected TGV, the ventricles are transposed such that the right atrium connects to the left ventricle, and the left atrium to the right ventricle.  The aorta arises from a morphologically appearing right ventricle (acting as a left ventricle) and carries oxygenated blood through the body.   The pulmonary artery arises from a morphologically appearing left ventricle (acting as the right ventricle)and carries deoxygenated blood to the lungs.\n\nPeople affected with congenitally corrected TVG may be asymptomatic throughout life but most develop symptoms from associated conditions, including other morphological and conduction abnormalities that require intervention (such as VSD, LV outflow obstruction to the lungs, tricuspid valve regurgitation [valve is exposed to systemic pressures], and complete heart block.)",

            "Disease Discussion": "The diagnostic approach and treatment for pulmonary embolism continues to be an evolving and controversial area in medicine.  Current recommendations are based on numerous studies, such as the PIOPED study.  Imaging modalities vary and can be situation or institution dependent.  The initial work-up for a pt suspected of having a pulmonary embolism involves a CXR in order to rule out other pulmonary or cardiac findings, such as a pneumothorax, pneumonia, or rib fracture.  If the CXR is non diagnostic, other imaging modalities include V/Q scan, helical CT with PE protocol, pulmonary angiography, echocardiography, or venous US of the lower extremities.  The gold standard is generally thought to be pulmonary angiography.      There are advantages and disadvantages to each modality.  CXR is rarely diagnostic of PE, nor does it often show the classic findings (Hampton\u2019s hump, Westermark\u2019s sign).  However, it can be useful for ruling out other pathology.  The most common findings on CXR in pt\u2019s with PE include atelectasis, pleural effusions, infiltrates, and elevation of the hemidaphragm.      V/Q scans also are rarely diagnostic.   The scans can be difficult to interpret and often meaningless if there is other underlying pulmonary pathology.  Additionally, the diagnosis of PE was highly dependent on the clinical suspicion of the physician.           More recently, helical CT has been used to aid in diagnosing PE.  Disadvantages include poor visualization of the periphery of the lungs at the subsegmental level.  The main advantage is the relative ease of the procedure and the decreased variable of reader interpretation (when compared to V/Q scans).      As previously stated, pulmonary angiography continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary emboli.  However, these studies are slightly more invasive than other modalities and can carry up to a 0.5% risk of mortality.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Congenital lobar emphysema (CLE) is a developmental anomaly of the lower respiratory tract that is characterized by hyperinflation of one or more of the pulmonary lobes. CLE is a rare congenital malformation. It was diagnosed in 10 of 70 patients with congenital malformations of the lung seen from 1970 to 1995 at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC. Depending upon the pattern of referrals, other tertiary medical centers may treat one or two cases per year.  Males appear to be affected more than females, in a ratio of 3:1.  The reason for the male predominance is unknown.  Progressive lobar hyperinflation is likely the final common pathway that results from a variety of disruptions in bronchopulmonary development. These result from abnormal interactions between embryonic endodermal and mesodermal components of the lung. Disturbances may lead to changes in the number of airways or alveoli or alveolar size. However, a definitive causative agent cannot be identified in approximately 50 percent of cases. The most frequently identified cause of CLE is obstruction of the developing airway, which occurs in 25 percent of cases.  Airway obstruction can be intrinsic or extrinsic, with the former more common. This leads to the creation of a \"ball-valve\" mechanism in which a greater volume of air enters the affected lobe during inspiration than leaves during expiration, producing air trapping.\nIntrinsic obstruction often is caused by defects in the bronchial wall, such as deficiency of bronchial cartilage. This results in airway collapse during expiration. Intraluminal obstruction caused by meconium or mucous plugs, granulomas, or mucosal folds can cause partial obstruction of a lower airway. Extrinsic compression may be caused by vascular anomalies, such as a pulmonary artery sling or anomalous pulmonary venous return, or intrathoracic masses, such as foregut cysts and teratomas.  CLE is characterized by overdistention of one or more lobes of the lung.  This leads to compression of the remaining lung tissue and herniation of the affected lobe across the anterior mediastinum into the opposite chest, causing displacement of the mediastinum.  The different pulmonary lobes are variably affected by CLE. The left upper lobe is affected most often (40 to 50 percent of cases).  The distribution in right middle, right upper, and lower lobes is 25 to 35, 20, and 2 to 10 percent, respectively. CLE affecting multiple lobes is rare.",

            "Title": "Acute ischemic stroke, CT perfusion imaging",
            "Disease Discussion": "Neuroimaging continues to be an important aspect of acute stroke management as it guides appropriate treatment decisions.  Noncontrast CT scan rules out hemorrhagic stroke immediately, but CT has poor sensitivity for demonstrating acute ischemic strokes.  However, more advanced neuroimaging, to include MRI with diffusion weighting has been used to better identify acute infarct.  Additionally, CT and MR perfusion imaging are able to detect early hemodynamic changes associated with ischemia and infarction.  Perfusion imaging can be useful to differentiate between potential salvageable ischemic tissue and tissue infarction.  This has many treatment implications, to include identification of patients amenable to catheter-directed therapies such as intraarterial thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, even if the patient is outside the accepted 3-hour time window for IV thrombolysis.\n     Measurements for brain perfusion include mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral blood flow (CBF).  For CT Perfusion, a tissue-at-risk map can be generated from these perfusion maps based on minimum threshold values for CBV and CBF to maintain brain viability.  Regions of increased MTT and mildly decreased CBF represent the penumbra and therefore are at risk for infarction.  Due to autoregulation and collateralization, CBV is usually last to be affected by ischemic events and the CBV is maintained as normal or slightly increased.  However, infarction is characterized by increased MTT coupled with significantly decreased CBF and CBV.  Identifying the penumbra is important as this area is potentially salvageable with prompt therapeutic intervention.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Infections of the biliary tract are the most common identifiable source of liver abscess.  Infection of the liver may occur via the bile duct, along a penetrating vessel, or from an adjacent septic focus.  Less commonly, liver abscess is a complication of bacteremia arising from underlying abdominal disease, such as diverticulitis, perforated or penetrating peptic ulcer, gastrointestinal malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, or peritonitis, or rarely from bacterial endocarditis.  Occasionally, a pyogenic liver abscess may be the presentation of a hepatocellular or gallbladder carcinoma or a complication of chemoembolization of a hepatic neoplasm.  In approximately 40% of cases, no obvious source of infection can be identified.  The most frequently isolated organisms are Escherichia coli and Klebsiella, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Streptococcus species, particularly Streptococcus milleri.  Most are polymicrobial.  With improved culture methods and earlier diagnosis, the number of cases identified as being caused by anaerobic organisms has also increased.  In the past, patients typically presented with acute spiking fevers, right upper quadrant pain, and often shock.  Since the introduction of antibiotics, the presentation has become less acute, and is often insidious.  The presentation is characterized by malaise, low-grade fever, weight loss, and dull abdominal pain that may increase with movement. Symptoms may be present for 1 month or more before a diagnosis is made.  Multiple abscesses are typical when biliary disease is the source and are associated with a more acute systemic presentation, often with sepsis and shock.  Solitary abscesses tend to present more insidiously.  When an abscess is situated near the dome of the liver, pain may be referred to the right shoulder, or a cough may be present resulting from diaphragmatic irritation or atelectasis.",

The incidence is 25,000.  Atlas fractures represent 10% or cervical spine injuries and 2% or all spine injuries.  Most cervical spine injuries occur in males age 15-24.  \n\nRadiology:  Atlas pathology can be detected by plain film images, especially with the odontoid, or open-mouth, view where lateral displacement of greater than 6.9mm is indicative of a fracture.  However, this modality has low sensitivity so diagnosis is facilitated by computed tomography(CT). Magnetic resonance imagine (MRI) is indicated for investigating soft tissue injury, such as when ligamentous disruption is suspected or when there are neurologic deficits.  Arteriography may be necessary to evaluate vascular injury.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment:  Isolated posterior arch and non- or minimally-displaced Jefferson fractures are considered stable.  Treatment is a rigid cervical collar for 8-12 weeks with follow-up imaging to re-evaluate stability.  The patient is expected to resume normal activity once the fracture has healed.  Any fracture where the lateral mass is displaced 7mm or more is considered unstable.  This requires halo traction for 3-6 weeks followed by further immobilization with a halo vest until stability is confirmed.  Even with an unstable fracture, the prognosis is favorable provided that there are no other associated injures (such as neurologic insults).",

The gas within the empyema was likely due to a bronchopleural fistula, secondary to either trauma from chest tube insertion or via necrosis of lung tissue. Alternatively, the gas may have come from one of the anaerobic microorganisms cultured from the purulent pleural fluid."

            "Title": "Empyema",
            "Disease Discussion": "A parapneumonic effusion is any pleural effusion associated with suppurative parenchymal lung disease. Simple parapneumonic effusions are uninfected, free-flowing fluid collections. Complicated parapneumonic effusions are early infected fluid collections prone to develop loculations by fibrinous septations. Empyema is a collection of frank pus within the pleural space. An effusion is termed complex when it develops loculations. The natural evolution of untreated simple and complicated parapneumonic effusions is to become complex and to progress to frank empyema with development of a residual cavity or entrapment of the lung by a fibrous peel or cortex.\n\nPneumonia results in parapneumonic effusion in approximately 45% of cases, although less than 5% of these progress to an empyema. Other common causes include mediastinal or pulmonary surgery and trauma. Less frequently, empyema may result from spread of infection from adjacent structures. Mortality from empyema ranges from 1% to 20%. \n\nClinical manifestations vary, depending on the underlying pulmonary process, the responsible organism, the quantity of bacteria and fluid in the pleural space, the stage of the disease, and the host defense mechanisms. The clinical presentation can range from an absence of symptoms to a severe febrile illness with toxemia and shock. In general, it is difficult to distinguish patients with infected pleural effusions from those with sterile parapneumonic effusions on the basis of history and physical examination alone. Clinical manifestations include fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough with mucopurulent sputum. Physical examination often reveals decreased breath sounds, dull percussion, and restricted respiratory excursions. \n\nWith the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-1940s, a significant shift occurred in the microbiology of pleural space infections. Anaerobic organisms are now the most common bacteria isolated from infected pleural effusions, being identified in up to 75% of cases, either alone (35%) or in combination with aerobic organisms (40%). Up to 35% of established empyemas have negative Gram stain evaluations and many patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions have negative culture results. Staphylococcus aureus is a relatively common cause of empyema in otherwise healthy adults, children and in patients who have had chest trauma or prior surgery, whereas alcoholic males are particularly susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. \n\nThoracentesis plays a critical role in the management of pleural effusions and in 90% of adult cases yields useful information. Fluid is removed and samples obtained for measurement of pH, glucose, LDH, protein, and differential cell count. An exudate is defined by: (1) a ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein greater than 0.5, (2) a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH greater than 0.6, or (3) a pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds of the upper normal limit for serum or >200 IU [3] . A transudate does not meet any of the above three criteria. \n\nIf the patient has a transudative effusion, no further laboratory tests on the pleural fluid are indicated. If the patient has an exudative pleural effusion, the remaining pleural fluid is sent for WBC and differential, cytologic examination, Gram's stain and cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacteria and fungi if clinically indicated. The aspiration of frank pus confirms the presence of empyema and establishes an absolute indication for urgent drainage of the pleural space. In this instance, Gram's stain and culture are the only laboratory studies necessary to guide initial therapy. Pleural fluid Gram's stains can identify pathogens in 55% to 65% of patients with established empyemas. \nThe posterior-anterior and lateral chest radiographs are the best initial diagnostic modalities. When the patient is upright, free pleural fluid first accumulates in the lowest part of the hemithorax\u2014the posterior costophrenic angles. Lateral decubitus views allow detection of 50 to 100 ml of fluid and the presence of loculations if the fluid fails to layer out along the dependent chest. In the view with the involved side superior, the free fluid layers against the mediastinum and one can assess how much of the radiodensity is due to the fluid and how much is due to a parenchymal infiltrate. In the view with the involved side dependent, the amount of free pleural fluid can be semi-quantitated by measuring the distance from the chest wall to the outside of the lung. If the thickness of fluid exceeds 10 mm, a diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated. However, it is not necessary to tap all parapneumonic effusions, especially if the volume of fluid remains small, the patient is doing well, the fluid moves freely, or serial roentgenograms show improvement. \n\nCT is of great value in the overall evaluation of parapneumonic effusions and should be done early in the assessment of patients with complex parapneumonic effusion or empyema. CT is helpful in (1) differentiating pleural fluid from peripheral parenchymal infiltrates or pleural thickening, (2) evaluating the parenchymal disease, (3) determining the presence of loculations, (4) characterizing the pleural surfaces, and (5) guiding and assessing therapy. Complicated effusions and empyemas are frequently associated with nearby pulmonary consolidation and can be mistaken for a lung abscess. A lung abscess usually presents as a poorly defined, roughly spherical mass surrounded by consolidated but non compressed lung. An empyema is usually elongated, conforms to the shape of the chest wall, and compresses the adjacent lung. Its wall is thin and uniform and the interface angle with the chest wall is obtuse. The margins of the empyema cavity are composed of inflamed visceral and parietal pleura that enhance after administration of intravenous contrast. The visceral and parietal layers are separated by the interposed empyema fluid, giving rise to the \u201csplit pleura sign\u201d.\n\nUS is widely available, provides guidance for thoracentesis or pleural catheter placement, and can be transported to the bedside. US is particularly useful for sampling fluid that does not layer freely on decubitus films, and can distinguish solid from liquid pleural abnormalities better than chest roentgenography. The presence of discrete pleural septations has prognostic importance because loculated collections require drainage for their resolution. Computed tomography, however, gives additional information not obtained by US.\n\nThe sine qua non of empyema management is early, adequate, and dependent drainage. The therapeutic armamentarium for parapneumonic effusion or empyema consists of antibiotic therapy, thoracentesis, chest tube drainage, image-guided percutaneous catheter drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic agents, and a variety of surgical drainage procedures, including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy.",

Acquired forms of agenesis are characterized by the development of renal tissue which atrophies either during development or during childhood.\n\nIncidence: between 1:500 and 1:1500 births\n\nEtiology: Failure of formation of the ureteral bud or because of an inherent deficiency of the metanephric blastema [in this case, partial development of the ureter may be present].\n\nImaging studies: In true agenesis, a hemitrigone is found in the bladder on cystoscopy.  No renal artery is present.  The colon occupies the renal fossa on the affected side, and this may suggest the diagnosis on plain films or barium enema.\n\nAssociated anomalies: The ipsilateral adrenal gland is absent in \n8-10% of cases.  Some investigators report a twofold increase in the incidence of congenital anomalies of the contralateral kidney.  Associated genital abnormalities in males may include cysts of the ipsilateral seminal vesicle, absence of the ipsilateral vas deferens, hypoplasia or agenesis of the testicle, and hypospadias.  In females, unicornuate or bicornuate uterus, absence or hypoplasia of the uterus, and absence or aplasia of the vagina (Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome) may be present.\n\nBilateral renal agenesis: This is extremely rare and is incompatible with life.  Males are affected in three-fourths of cases.  Infants demonstrate characteristic features of Potter's syndrome including low-set ears and a prominent palpebral fold.\n\nSupernumerary kidney: Extremely rare.

(MRI produces exquisite detail of the spinal cord. Most tumors are isointense or slightly hypointense compared to the normal cord signal. Contrast-enhanced MRI is very sensitive for tumors and may disclose minute lesions). This patient should be followed by neurology on a routine basis.  Any new onset in local or radiating pain, progressive weakness in the arms or legs, loss of balance and impaired bowel or bladder function should initiate a complete neurologic workup. Examination may reveal a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs. Lower motor signs may be at the level of the lesion and may aid in localization.  Other signs upon physical examination may include spine tenderness, stiffening of gait, trophic changes of extremities or sensory loss.  If the patient becomes symptomatic the benefits of surgical removal of the tumor(s) should be weighed against the intrinsic risk of surgery in this patient. Absolute contraindications to surgical intervention include uncorrected coagulopathy and systemic infection. Relative contraindications to surgical intervention include complete neurologic deficit over 24 hours and short life expectancy (which should be considered in this patient).  Additionally, although tumors that give rise to symptoms or those that become malignant are generally excised, if the tumor is on a vital nerve, excision may be impossible . Radiation therapy prior to surgery may be of benefit. \nNo laboratory tests are specific or sensitive to tumors arising from the spinal cord. Genetic testing may benefit patient\u2019s children.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Spinal tumors can be divided into extradural, intradural extramedullary, and intradural intramedullary. (each subset is briefly described below). The location of the soft tissue mass-like lesion in this patient is representative of an intradural-extramedullary tumor (ie. neurofibroma, meningioma or schwannoma- see discussion below).\n\nExtradural tumors:  usually metastatic and most often arise in the vertebral bodies. Metastatic lesions can cause spinal cord compression either by intradural invasion or, more commonly, by epidural growth that results in extrinsic spinal cord or cauda equina compression. \n\nIntradural-extramedullaryTumors: arise within the dura, but outside the actual spinal cord. They are usually nerve sheath tumors or meningiomas. \n\nIntramedullary Tumors: arise within the spinal cord itself.  The majority are gliomas, either astrocytomas or ependymomas, although metastases are recognized with increasing frequency. Although most spinal tumors are extradural, most primary spinal malignancies are intradural. The thoracic, lumbosacral, and cervical spinal canal is involved in 50, 30, and 20 percent of cases, respectively. \n\nIntradural-extramedullary Tumors:\nMeningiomas can arise from arachnoidal cells anywhere along the neuraxis and are occasionally found in association with neurofibromatosis.  Approximately 90 percent of the tumors occur within the cranial fossa and the majority of spinal meningiomas occur within the thoracic spine (of note: this patient has a prior hx of intracranial meningioma). The tumors are frequently adherent to the spinal dura, requiring dural resection for complete removal, and also grow along intradural and extradural components of the nerve roots. Spinal meningiomas are typically slowly growing invasive lesions and often erode bone. Rarely, the tumors may be considered malignant or aggressive if they demonstrate a proclivity to recur. The usual treatment for spinal meningiomas is resection; complete resection can often be achieved. The dural origin is generally cauterized and occasionally resected. Thoracic spinal roots may be sacrificed as necessary to obtain a complete resection; however, cervical and lumbar roots are preserved whenever possible. Subtotally resected lesions are generally followed expectantly for regrowth. Symptomatic recurrences are generally treated with further surgery.\nSchwannomas are generally benign lesions that arise from schwann cells that normally produce the myelin coverings of nerve roots. These lesions are slow growing and cause compression of nerve roots and other neural elements. The tumors can be intradural or extradural in location and are often dumbbell-shaped. Their biologic behavior is similar to neurofibromas (see below) but they do not, as a rule, invade the nerve. Schwannomas are generally encapsulated and may have both an extradural and intradural component and cause widening the neural foramina. Treatment consists of tumor resection, though sacrificing the nerve to ensure complete removal may be required. Additionally, complete resection may require removal of the facet joints and reconstruction of the spine may be necessary. \nNeurofibromas are biologically similar to schwannomas but the incidence is lower, except in patients with neurofibromatosis (see below). The tumors usually develop along peripheral or cranial nerves and are a central feature of neurofibromatosis 1, where they may occur intracranially or involve several spinal roots.  Involvement of peripheral nerves is manifest as firm, rubbery, subcutaneous lesions. Tumors found in association with the spinal nerve roots (as seen in this patient) are grossly similar in appearance to schwannomas. Nerve dysfunction may be caused by fusiform enlargement of the nerve with encasement of the axons by fibrous strands. Neurofibromas can be identified easily with MR imaging. The lesions are ovoid in appearance and increase in intensity with the administration of contrast material. CT myelography may demonstrate focal epidural compression at the involved site, and further delineate the tumor extent. The treatment for symptomatic neurofibromas is surgical resection. However, because there is usually no clear plane between the tumor and the nerve it is impossible to remove the tumor without sacrificing the involved nerve. The prognosis is good for the removal of a single neurofibroma. In cases of neurofibromatosis, the prognosis is poorer because of the multiplicity of lesions and the possibility that one of the lesions will undergo malignant transformation. \nNeurofibromatosis is an inherited disorder and is divided into two types. Neurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen\u2019s disease) is characterized cutaneous neurofibromas, pigmented lesions of the skin called caf? au lait spots, freckling in non-sun exposed areas such as the axilla, hamartomas of the iris termed Lisch nodules, and pseudoarthrosis of the tibia. It is associated with a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17 that codes for the protein, rofibromin, which modulates signal transduction through the ras GTPase pathway. Patients with NF1 are at increased risk of developing nervous system gliomas, ependymomas, meningiomas, astrocytomas and pheochromocytomas. Neurofibromas may undergoe secondary malignant degeneration and become sarcomas. Neurofibromatosis 2 is sometimes called central neurofibromatosis. It is caused by a gene on chromosome 22. Bilateral schwannomas of the acoustic nerve and multiple meningiomas are characteristic.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The Bosniak classification of renal cysts has been a has been a relatively consistent way of distinguishing benign renal cystic disease from renal cell carcinoma (or other cancers) since 1986.  This system uses radiologic findings from CT or ultrasound to classify renal \"cysts\" into four categories.\nIsrael & Bosniak - http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/full/236/2/441\nTable of Classes - http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content-nw/full/236/2/441/T1\n\u2022  Class 1:\n\u00bb Homogeneous water attenuation\n\u00bb No internal architecture\n\u00bb No enhancement\nThe first category includes only simple cysts that are homogeneous, have well defined margins, are -10 to +20 Hounsfield units in density (like that of water), do not contain septa, calcifications, nor solid components; and, they do not enhance with contrast.  This is the most common category, occurring in at least 50% of the population over 50 years of age.  This is also the most benign category and requires little if any follow-up.\n\n\u2022  Class 2:\nThe second category includes simple cysts that may have additional radiologic findings.  Findings that will increase the classification from Class 1 to Class 2 include:\n\u00bb  the presence of thin hyaline septa\n\u00bb  mild calcification in the cyst wall or in the thin septa\n\u00bb  uniform hyperdensity\n\nThese have < 5% chance of malignancy and often are not provided follow up.\n\nThere has been much controversy in the literature about inter-observer variability when it comes to the distinguishing between class 2 and class 3 cysts.  This forced the classification system to give rise to a new category so as to more accurately describe the range between Class 2 and Class 3 cysts. \n \n\u2022  Class 2F (meaning \"needs follow-up\"): \n\u00bb  multiple thin septa that may have mild or moderate nodular calcification\n\u00bb  mild thickening of the wall or septa\n\u00bb  minimal \"perceived enhancement\" of cyst wall or septa\n\u00bb  non-enhancing hyperdense intrarenal cysts > 3cm\n\nClass 2F cysts may require 6 month follow-up exams over 24 months.\n\nAll Class 2 and 2F cysts may NOT have \"measurable enhancement\" with contrast and should be generally well marginated.\n\n\u2022  Class 3:\nThe third category includes complex cysts that have irregular, thickened walls and/or septa.  These cysts may have extensive calcification and will enhance with contrast.  However, these cysts should be relatively homogeneous in density and should not contain solid components.\n\nThese masses need surgical intervention in most cases, because they may be:\n\u00bb MLCN - Multiloculated Cystic Nephroma\n\u00bb Hemorrhagic cysts\n\u00bb Infected cysts\n\n\u2022  Class 4:\nThe fourth and last Bosniak category can include all of the previously stated components - but show definite enhancing soft-tissue regions, appear heterogeneous in density, and have various solid or hypercalcified inclusions - indicating possible necrosis.  In previous studies, this class has always been shown to indicate cancer on follow-up pathological report - and they should be removed. \n \nMany small retrospective studies have shown the Bosniak classification system to be quite useful in making a clinical decision between choosing surgical therapy versus clinical follow-up with serial CT scans. \n\nIts only criticism comes from individuals who feel that the radiologic inter-observer variability is too large and is a major diagnostic concern.\n\neMedicine - http://www.emedicine.com/med/topic3189.htm\n\nCTISUS - http://www.ctisus.org/cta_web/8_05/Fielding/AR_08-05_CTA_Fielding.htm\n\nRadiology - http://radiology.rsnajnls.org/cgi/content/abstract/231/2/365\n\nAJR - http://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/full/181/5/1425",

Scaphocephaly results from sagittal suture synostosis. The cranium has reduced width and compensatory elongation in the anteroposterior or sagittal axis.\n\nThe major complications associated with craniosynostosis are inhibition of brain growth and increased intracranial pressure. Brain growth is inhibited by prolonged uncorrected restriction of cranial growth. Compression of underlying brain is more likely when multiple sutures are affected. \n\nThe mechanism of synostosis is unknown.  One mechanism proposes an intrinsic abnormality in the cranial base that causes early fusion. This theory is supported by laboratory studies of osteoblasts from craniosynostotic sutures.  Craniosynostosis also has been associated with endocrine abnormalities, such as hyperthyroidism, and use of warfarin during pregnancy.\n\nThe diagnosis of craniofacial deformities is based primarily upon physical examination. Historically, pattern recognition has been the basis for clinical diagnosis. Radiographic studies including plain radiographs and CT may be used to help confirm or exclude the diagnosis of craniosynostosis.\n\nScaphocephaly is treated by a strip craniectomy performed at three or four months of age. A limitation of this technique is that reossification and growth arrest can occur prior to completion of remodeling. In children six months to one year of age, a Pi or T craniectomy can be utilized to improve the cephalic contour. If the deformity is severe, barrel-stave osteotomies with rearrangement of cranial segments is required to achieve the desired contour.",

If a malignancy is found, the patient has a wide resection of the tumor. If the ABC is symptomatic and no malignancy is seen, curettage is the treatment of choice.  Selective embolization, intralesional injection, irradiation, and en bloc resection have also been described. Recurrence rates are not uncommon with these bone cysts, occurring approximately 0-30%.",

            "Title": "Intraosseous Lipoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Intraosseous lipomas is an uncommon benign bone lesion that accounts for approximately 0.1% of bone tumors. Common sites of occurrence include the femoral neck and calcaneus. They can also occur in the flat bones, the pelvis, and other locations. \nHistopathologically, intraosseous lipomas are categorized into three types: stage 1, solid tumor composed of viable lipocytes; stage 2, transitional cases with partial fat necrosis and focal calcification intermixed with regions of viable lipocytes; and stage 3, advanced cases in which fat cells have died with variable degree of cyst formation, calcification, and reactive new bone formation. The progression from stage 1 to stage 3 is caused by ischemia and infarction within the lesion and is thought to be related to the rigid structure of bone opposing the lesion\u2019s fat cell expansion and multiplication. These lesions may also cause resorption and expansion of bone, whereas bone infarcts do not cause expansion of the bone.\n  The radiographic features of intraosseous lipomas are based upon the histologic stage of the lesion. The stage 1 lesions are lucent and represent viable fat with resorption of bony trabeculae. Stage 2 lesions have lucent areas, which consist of viable fat and radiodense areas that consist of fat necrosis and dystrophic calcification. Stage 2 lesions can be expansile. Stage 3 lesions reflect resorption of normal bone, but they are more radiodense than stage 1 or 2 lesions. The radiodensity is a result of calcification and extensive fat necrosis. Stage 3 lesions also have thick sclerotic borders, presumably related to involution of these lesions. Radiologically, the differential diagnosis of intraosseous lipomas includes fibrous dysplasia, aneurysmal bone cysts, simple bone cysts, bone infarcts, chondroid tumors, and liposclerosing myxofibrous tumors. \n  On CT, stage 1 intraosseous lipomas exhibit resorption of bone trabeculae in the lesion and bone expansion. The area of lucency seen on the radiograph corresponds to fat attenuation visible on CT. Stage 2 lesions have areas of fat attenuation and patchy areas of increased density corresponding to calcification and fat necrosis. Stage 3 intraosseous lipomas are the most difficult to diagnose because of the reactive ossification, calcification, fat necrosis, and cyst formation caused by necrosis of the fat component. If the lesion has a peripheral rim of discernible fat, it will help to eliminate other conditions generally considered in the differential diagnosis. Lesions that exhibit resorption of trabecular bone and predominantly central calcification instead of peripheral calcification are more likely to be stage 3 intraosseous lipomas than bone infarcts; the latter are non-expansile lesions that have a peripheral serpentine thin rim of sclerosis and are not associated with trabecular resorption. \n  MR imaging reveals viable fat in stage 1 intraosseous lipomas. The fat is isointense to subcutaneous fat on T1-weighted sequences and exhibits low signal intensity with fat suppression on T2-weighted images. A thin circumferential rim of low signal intensity on T1- and T2- weighted sequences is typically present demarcating the margin of the fatty lesion consistent with reactive sclerosis surrounding the lesion. In stage 2 lesions, one can again identify fat and the circumferential rim of decreased signal on T1- and T2-weighted images. Low-signal-intensity areas within the central portion of the lesion on T1- and T2-weighted images are consistent with calcifications.  Stage 3 lesions show a thin peripheral rim of fat, which can be identified on MR imaging. They also have central calcification and a thick rim of surrounding sclerosis, which have low signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted sequences. Areas of fat necrosis have a variable signal on T1-weighted and increased signal on T2-weighted images.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Brain embolism usually presents abruptly with clinical abnormalities. Fluctuations or worsening symptoms and sudden improvements are common during the first 24 to 48 hours, probably because of emboli passing distally. Usually embolic infarcts are large, and deficits are more severe in patients with emboli than with in situ occlusions. Single or infrequent but longer lasting TIAs may precede embolic infarctions. Embolic events often occur during activity or sudden straining, coughing, or sneezing. Infarcts may involve multiple vascular territories and are mixed in age. Early angiographic or TCD studies may show the presence of distal intra-arterial emboli. Hemorrhagic conversion of infarcted areas is commonly noted on CT and MRI scans. Infarcts are often wedge-shaped and involve the cerebral cortical surface.(1)\n\nAtrial fibrillation is the underlying cause of 30,000 to 40,000 embolic strokes per year in the United States. The precentage of AF caused strokes increases with age, rising from 1.5 percent in patients aged 50 to 59 years to 23.5 percent in patients aged 80 to 89 years. Although co-morbid conditions such as hypertension and vascular disease are factors, the predominant cause of strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation is embolization of a clot from the left atrium.\n\nWhen evaluated using transesophageal echocardiography, up to 30 percent of patients with atrial fibrillation and embolic stroke are found to have atrial thrombi within 72 hours of the stroke. Risk factors for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation include a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, age greater than 65 years, a history of hypertension, the presence of a prosthetic heart valve (mechanical or tissue), rheumatic heart disease, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or diabetes.(2)",

The diagnosis is made when the diseased appendix is identified as a tubular, noncompressible structure measuring 6mm or more in diameter and demonstrating no peristalsis.

Further reassuring is the lack of calcification.  These lesions should be followed, as they can hemorrhage when large.  The AML is a hamartomatous lesion, considered ostensibly benign although sarcomatous degeneration has rarely been known to occur.  In the vast majority of cases, however, a renal lesion (partially exophytic 25% of the time) containing macroscopic fat, HU < -60, and internal soft tissue components is an AML until proven otherwise.  There is a 15% association with Tuberous Sclerosis."

            "Disease Discussion": "An angiomyolipoma (AML) is a hamartomatous lesion containing fat, smooth muscle, and blood vessels.  AMLs are felt to represent a subset of familial neoplasms derived from perivascular epithelioid cells.  Most are asymptomatic, and one source (Eble) reports an incidence of 13 per 10,000 adults.\n\nThe typical imaging finding is fat in a renal lesion, thought by many to be virtually diagnostic of AML.  Rarely, however, renal cell cancers and oncocytomas can also contain fat.  Hence, these lesions should also be considered in the differential.\n\nSmall lesions generally receive no treatment, with resection or embolization being reserved for larger or symptomatic lesions.  The primary complication associated with this lesion is spontaneous hemorrhage.  Other possible complications include extension into the inferior vena cava and spread to local lymph nodes without progression to malignancy.  It should be noted, however, that one subtype of AML, the epithelioid angiomyolipoma, does have malignant potential.\n\nAMLs, in particular bilateral AMLs, are associated with tuberous sclerosis.  In tuberous sclerosis, concurrent cysts and, occasionally, renal cell carcinoma may be present.\n\nHormones may stimulate the growth of these lesions as evidenced by the observations that (1) they are generally diagnosed only after puberty in patients with tuberous sclerosis, (2) large AMLs are more common in women than in men, and (3) AMLs sometimes demonstrate significant growth during pregnancy.",

            "Title": "Hypoparathyroidism",
            "Disease Discussion": "In 1939, Drake et al. established the following criteria for the diagnosis of hypoparathyroidism:  1) low serum calcium; b) high serum inorganic phosphorus level; c) the absence of renal insufficiency, steatorrhea, chronic diarrhea, and alkalosis; d) exclusion of rickets and osteomalacia.\n\nThe disease may result from a deficiency in parathyroid hormone production or an end organ resistance to the action of the hormone.  Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) was first described by Albright et al. in 1942.  It is a congenital hereditary abnormality that appears to be transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, basal ganglion and soft tissue calcification.\n\nIn PHP, there is a defect in the parathyroid hormone receptor-adenylate cyclase system which accounts for end organ resistance.\n\nIn most patients with classic PHP, there is a deficiency of guanyl nucleotide regulatory protein (G-unit) that normally couples receptor activity to adenylate cyclase activity.  As a result, the kidney and, less commonly, the bones are unable to respond to parathyroid hormone.  There may also be renal inability to hydroxylase 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D, the active form.\n\nPseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) was the name selected by Albright and Reifenstein to describe a syndrome in short-statured patients with rounded faces, whose roentgen features simulated exactly those of PHP, the difference being the absence of blood chemical changes.\n\nOsteosclerosis, which may be generalized or localized, is the most common skeletal abnormality of hypoparathyroidism.  Typically, radiographic findings include increased radiodensity of the skeleton, calvarial thickening and hypoplastic dentition.  Subcutaneous calcification may be seen, especially in the area of the hips and shoulders.\n\nParticularly suggestive of hypoparathyroidism are intracranial calcifications of the basal ganglia that may later coalesce into homogeneous masses.  Occasionally, these calcifications develop in the cerebellum.\n\nThe clinical syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri in association with hypoparathyroidism was reported as early as 1959 by Palmer et al.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:  Skeletal osteosclerosis is also seen in certain other disorders such as osteoblastic metastasis, myelofibrosis, Paget's disease, fluorosis, renal osteodystrophy, sickle cell anemia, and mastocytosis.  In these and other diseases, other radiographic findings are usually apparent, allowing accurate diagnosis.  In hypoparathyroidism and PHP, calvarial thickening and hypoplastic dentition are helpful clues, although Paget's disease, sickle cell anemia, and even metastasis may produce increased thickening and sclerosis of the calvarial vault.\n\nBasal ganglion calcification is particularly characteristic of hypoparathyroidism and PHP.  It is also seen without known cause in infectious disorders such as toxoplasmosis and cytomegalic inclusion disease, following radiation therapy, and following exposure to toxic substances such as carbon monoxide.\n\nSubcutaneous calcifications are also seen in collagen vascular disease, hypervitaminosis D, milk alkali syndrome, and renal osteodystrophy.  Hypoplastic dentition is also seen in cleidocranial dysostosis and pyknodysostosis, hypopituitarism, and hypothyroidism.\n\nSclerosis of the metaphyseal region of long bones seen in some patients with hypoparathyroidism is not specific.  It may be seen in children with systemic illness leading to growth arrest lines, leukemia during treatment, heavy metal poisoning, hypothyroidism, healing scurvy, and hypervitaminosis.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Acute bacterial infections of the salivary glands are uncommon but are usually due to Staphylococcus  aureus, Streptococcus, and Haemophillus influenza.   Predisposing factors include decreased flow, dehydration, post radiation, chemotherapy, imunosuppression, and recent dental work. TB and cat scratch fever can cause granulomatous sialadenitis.  Acute infectious sialadenitis is most commonly viral.  The most common viral cause is mumps (a myxovirus) which usually involves only the parotid glands bilaterally.  Other viral causes include HIV, coxsackie, and influenza. \n\nClinical findings:\nSigns and symptoms include erythema, pain, tenderness, and swelling which may increase with eating. Frank pus may drain from the ducts, especially with massage of the glands.  Adenopathy may be associated. \n \nComplications:\nInfection of the submandibular gland can lead to abscess and Ludwig\u2019s Angina, which is a life-threatening infection of the sublingual and submental spaces.  Other complications include stricture of the ducts and chronic sialadenitis.\n\nRadiographic imaging:\nWith infectious indications, CT should be the mainstay of imaging. Noncontrast imaging is useful to identify sialolythiasis and contrast imaging to identify abscesses, cysts, adenopathy and possible neoplasms.  If infection is less likely and there is a strong suspicion of neoplasm, fat-saturated MR is the study of choice.  Sialography is reserved for the evaluation of chronic sialadenitis without stones.   Conventional sialography may be replaced by thin section MR sialography.\n\nTreatment:\nOral antibiotics and hydration are usually sufficient.  Palliative methods to decrease inflammation include warm compresses and massage and/or sialogogues to promote drainage.  Small abscesses can be treated conservatively as well.  Abscesses that do not respond to antibiotic treatment may require surgical drainage.",

Lung cancer is generally categorized histologically into one of four major types of carcinoma: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, large cell, and small cell. The former three are distinguished from the latter as non-small cell tumors, in contradistinction to small cell carcinoma, which is generally faster growing and will more likely respond to chemotherapy. Small cell carcinoma only accounts for about 20% of all lung cancers, while the remaining 80% are mostly non-small cell tumors. The type of non-small cell carcinoma seen in this patient, squamous cell, accounts for 20-30% of all lung cancers. It can be distinguished histologically based upon keratin production and the presence of intercellular bridges as seen on light microscopy. \n\n             In terms of clinical presentation, cough is present in 45-75% of patients with lung cancer2, and is the most common associated symptom. Squamous cell carcinoma in particular may be associated with elevated serum calcium levels (not noted in this patient) secondary to production of a parathyroid-like hormone, although hypercalcemia may also be the result of metastatic bone disease. Initial workup includes a chest x-ray with two views.

Without recurrent metastasis, survival may be 80% or higher. Treatment includes surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, bone marrow transplant, and clinical trials.",

            "Title": "Fourth Branchial Cleft Cyst",
            "Disease Discussion": "The branchial apparatus serves as an embryological precursor to the tissues of the neck.  It consists of four branchial arches, clefts and pouches.  The branchial arches form musculoskeletal and vascular structures of the head and neck while the pouches form the middle ear, tonsils, thymus and parathyroid gland.  The first branchial clefts give rise to the external ear but the other three branchial clefts involute during normal development.  Failure of the other branchial clefts to involute forms a branchial cleft cyst.  Rarely, when a residual branchial cleft connects with a pouch structure, a complete sinus tract from the pharynx to a blind pouch cyst will form.\n\nBranchial cleft anomalies differ in clinical presentation depending on the specific cleft that fails to involute.  Classically, branchial cleft cysts present as a well demarcated mass along the anterior upper third along the sternocleidomastoid muscle.  This presentation is consistent with a second branchial cleft cyst which accounts for 95% of branchial cleft anomalies.  Fourth branchial cleft anomalies are the rarest developmental defect of the branchial apparatus.  These defects commonly form a fistula extending from the apex of the pyriform sinus to end as a blind pouch near the superior pole of the thyroid gland.  \n\nFourth branchial anomalies are often not appreciated on physical exam until they become secondarily infected.  Typical presentation is that of an inflammatory neck mass, often involving the thyroid gland.  These lesions most commonly occur on the left side of the neck.  Common sources of secondary infection include oropharyngeal pathogens that inoculate the sinus tract, usually after an upper respiratory infection or surgical manipulation of the oral cavity.  Infections can present as generalized erythema and cellulitis along the sinus tract or as supprative thyroditis.  Recurrent supprative thyroiditis is highly suggestive of a fourth branchial cleft sinus.\n\nThe initial imaging test of choice is a contrast enhanced CT scan of the neck to detect the location and extent of the lesion.  Finding air within a left-sided neck infection in close relation to the thyroid gland is thought to be almost pathognomonic for a fourth branchial cleft sinus tract.  A barium study of the pharynx is often utilized to further localize the path of the sinus tract.  Ultimately, definitive diagnosis occurs by direct pharyngoscopy to identify the origin of the sinus tract within the pyriform sinus.\n\nInitial management consists of antibiotic therapy.  The antibiotic regimen will vary depending on culture results if a biopsy is performed or the clinician\u2019s judgment if not performed.  Definitive treatment is surgical excision.  Incision and drainage is a poor therapeutic option given the high rate of recurrence without obliteration of the sinus tract.  An isolated cyst that has become secondarily infection can be excised once antibiotics have controlled local inflammation.  With fourth branchial cleft sinus tracts, optimal therapy consists of closure of the sinus opening.  Surgical options for closure include endoscopic assisted monopolar diathermy, abrasion with Tisseel surgical sealant closure of the sinus or another variation of the same theme.  Depending on the level of thyroid involvement, an ispilateral hemithyroidectomy may be required.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Retropharyngeal abscess (RPA) is a disease most commonly seen in children.  It is typically associated with viral upper respiratory infections, pharyngitis, and otitis media.  These conditions commonly result in adenopathy and RPA is theorized to stem from suppuration of the retropharyngeal lymph nodes.  The most common organisms grown from these abscesses are Group A Beta-hemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, and Hemophilus influenza.  RPA is seen in adults but is often associated with an underlying illness, oral trauma, or dental work.  The diagnosis of RPA is based on clinical as well as radiological findings.  The presence of soft tissue swelling in the retropharyngeal space on a lateral X-ray (>7 mm @ C2 and >22 mm @ C6) combined with clinical symptoms of pharyngitis, throat erythema, edema is highly suggestive of RPA.  Likewise, any abnormal fluid collection in the retropharyngeal space seen on CT combined with physical symptoms is likely RPA.  The primary danger of RPA is the spreading of the infection into the area of the carotid sheaths or into a potential space found between the alar and prevertebral fascia which extends into the mediastinum.  Treatment typically includes surgical incision and drainage coupled with broad spectrum antibiotic coverage.",

There is a slight upper lobe predominance, which may be associated with prophylaxis with aerosolized pentamidine.  Upper lobe thin-walled cysts can develop in 30% of AIDS patients, which can result in pneumothorax.  \n\nUncommon plain film findings include multiple pulmonary nodules (some of which may cavitate), a miliary pattern, reticular opacities, and asymmetric consolidation.\n\nPleural effusions and enlarged lymph nodes are associated rarely.\n\nCT:  Ground glass opacities on HRCT are the predominant finding.  Superimposed smooth intralobular and interlobular septal thickening can also be seen (\u201ccrazy-paving\u201d).  Upper lobe cysts can be demonstrated more frequently on CT.

            "Disease Discussion": "Lesions/Condition:  Benign Adrenal Adenoma\n\nSymptoms:  \n\nPatients with benign, nonhyperfunctioning adrenal adenomas typically are asymptomatic, with normal adrenal hormone levels.\n\n\nDiscussion:  \n\n\nAdrenal masses are common, occurring as incidental findings in as much as 9% of the population.  In patients with either a known malignancy or no known malignancy, benign adrenal masses are more common than adrenal gland metastases.  It is important to be able to differentiate between a benign and malignant adrenal mass as the distinction ultimately affects treatment decisions and overall prognosis for oncology patients.  \n\nBenign adrenal adenomas contain increased intracytoplasmic lipid content resulting in low attenuating lesions (less than 10 HU) on noncontrast CT scans.  Typically, adrenal adenomas are smaller than 4 cm, appearing as smoothly marginated, homogeneous, round masses.  In contrast, metastatic lesions to the adrenal gland are large, heterogeneous, lobulated masses with poorly defined margins, and contain very little intracellular fat.\n\nAn attenuation value of less than 10 HU on noncontrast CT scans is diagnostic of an adrenal adenoma.  However it is important to note that an attenuation value greater than 10 HU is not necessarily diagnostic of a metastatic lesion.  Approximately 30% of benign adenomas will yield attenuation values greater than 10 HU.  Thus, contrast enhanced CT can be employed to further characterize a adrenal lesion.\n\nAfter the administration of intravenous contrast material, benign adrenal adenomas avidly enhance, and the washout of contrast material is more rapid than with metastases.  Comparing noncontrast scans, with immediate postcontrast scans, and following with delayed postcontrast scans (15 minutes after contrast administration) the percentage enhancement washout of a adrenal lesion can be calculated, and determined as benign or malignant.  \n\nPercentage enhancement washout is calculated as the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the delayed enhancement attenuation divided by the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the nonenhanced attenuation multiplied by 100%.  If the percentage enhancement washout is greater than 60%, then the adrenal lesion can be characterized as a benign adrenal adenoma.  Additionally, if the nonenhanced attenuation is unavailable, the relative percentage enhancement washout can be calculated similarly as the immediate enhancement attenuation minus the delayed enhancement attenuation divided by the immediate enhancement attenuation multiplied by 100%.  If the relative percentage enhancement washout is greater than 50%, then the adrenal lesion can be classified as a benign adrenal adenoma.  Values of less than either 60% or 50% for the appropriate calculation are indicative of either a metastases or an atypical adenoma.\n\nIf an adrenal lesion cannot be adequately characterized on contrast enhanced CT, chemical shift MR imaging can be used exploiting the knowledge that adrenal adenomas contain intracellular lipid.  Chemical shift MR is the difference in behavior of lipid and water protons in a magnetic field.  Within an imaged voxel, gradient echo image sequences are performed to separate fat and water protons.  Using the spleen as an internal standard, demonstrating loss of signal within an adrenal mass on the T1-weighted out-of-phase image when compared to a corresponding T1-weighted in-phase image, confirms the presence of intracellular lipid, which characterizes a benign adrenal adenoma.  A metastatic lesion will not demonstrate a loss of signal intensity on the T1-weighted out-of-phase image, secondary to its poor intracytoplasmic lipid composition.\n\nOf note, chemical shift imaging and nonenhanced CT are not complimentary, since both modalities will most likely characterize the same subset of lipid-rich adenomas.\n\n\nFollow-up:\n\nFollowing the change in a lesion\u2019s size is a useful indicator in predicting malignancy.  Adrenal adenomas are slow growing, remaining stable in size and appearance on follow-up examinations.",

            "Discussion": "Hemangioblastomas are uncommon vascular tumors of the central nervous system that occur mainly in the cerebellum and spinal cord. They are benign neoplasms of endothelial origin; most commonly seen in young and middle aged adults.  They are the most common primary cerebellar neoplasm in adults 40-60 years old.  Among patients with hemangioblastoma, 25 percent occur in those with von Hippel-Lindau disease. On the other hand, hemangioblastomas are the most common lesions associated with VHL disease, eventually affecting 44 to 80 percent of patients. Sporadic hemangioblastoma are usually solitary; multiple tumors within the neuraxis should raise suspicion for VHL disease.\nHemangioblastomas cause neurologic deficits, both by direct compression or tumor-associated hemorrhage. The specific deficit from direct compression depends upon tumor location, and may include cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor nerve dysfunction, motor weakness, or sensory deficits. Patients with spinal hemangioblastomas frequently present with pain.  Secondary to this associated risk of hemorrhage, surgical treatment is indicated, as in this patient.\n\nThe diagnostic procedure of choice is gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  The classic appearance is a well-defined cystic mass with an intensely enhancing mural nodule (60% of cases).  Because the tumor nodule receives it\u2019s blood supply from the pia mater, the nodule, which represents the tumor itself, is almost always superficial.  Up to 40% are entirely solid.  In these cases, the margins can be ill-defined and occasionally can see hemorrhage.  Surrounding edema may be present.  Flow voids within the nodule may be present.\n\nAn acute hemorrhage secondary to hemangioblastoma can be catastrophic.  Intracerebral bleeding from a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may cause rapid obstructive hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, brainstem compression, or uncal herniation. Bleeding from a spinal hemangioblastoma may result in acute quadriplegia or paraplegia from hemorrhage into the spinal cord.  Headache, back pain, or radiculopathy can result from subarachnoid hemorrhage. In these situations, emergency neurosurgical intervention is indicated.\n\nReferences:\nBrant WE, Helms CA.

            "Disease Discussion": "Cerebellar  hemangioblastomas  are benign neoplasms of vascular origin.    They are not malformations.  They account for less than 3% of all intracranial neoplasms (1).  These tumors are most common  in  young  and middle-aged  adults,  where the incidence in males exceeds that of females (2).  The cerebellar hemisphere is the most common location, although they may be located in  the  spinal  cord,  brain stem,  or cerebral  hemispheres.    Ten percent of hemangioblastomas occur as part of the von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n\nSixty percent of these tumors are cystic, as in this case.  The enhancing mural nodule is a common finding in hemangioblastoma.  At CT,  the  cystic  portion of the tumor appears low density and does not enhance, while the  mural  nodule  enhances  homogeneously  and intensely.  The  MR  findings,  as  seen  in this case, include a predominantly cystic tumor with long  T1  and  long  T2  relaxation times,  and  intense enhancement of the peripheral nodule following gadolinium administration.  If the vascular nodule has bled  or  is proteinaceous,  it  may  be  hyperintense  on  short TR precontrast sequences.  More than one  enhancing  tumor  nodule  may  be  seen. Forty  percent  of hemangioblastomas are solid and display variable degrees of contrast enhancement.\n\nLateral  projections of a left vertebral artery subtraction angiogram (arterial and venous phases) in another patient with hemangioblastoma are shown in Films .6 and .7.  The angiographic findings are characteristic for a hemangioblastoma.  Notice the focal  enhancing nodule  fed  predominantly  by  the  superior cerebellar artery and seen densely enhancing in the arterial phase.   Because of  significant  artifact  in  the  posterior  fossa on CT, a small peripheral nodule may be missed and angiography is felt to be more sensitive  than  contrast  CT scan for detecting nodules.  MRI with Gd-DTPA may replace angiography for  evaluation  of  patients  with suspected hemangioblastoma.\n\nvon  Hippel-Lindau  disease  is  an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete and variable penetrance (3).  The incidence is equal in males and females.  Multiple lesions have been reported in  this syndrome,  but  the  most important lesions which cause significant morbidity include retinal angiomatosis, cerebellar or  spinal  cord hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.  Over  50% of patients with this syndrome have hemangioblastomas of the retina, which may present with acute or  chronic  retinal  detachment.  Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals these lesions, and radiographic evaluation plays a small role.\n\nThirty-six  to sixty percent of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have cerebellar hemangioblastoma.  Signs and symptoms due  to  this tumor  are  the  most common cause for patients to present with the syndrome.\n\nAlthough  the reported occurrence of spinal cord hemangioblastoma is 5%, autopsy data  and  MRI  suggest  the  incidence  may  be higher (4,5).    Signs and symptoms of a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may be dramatic, and neurologic deficit from a spinal  cord  lesion may  be overlooked.  Typical MR findings in a spinal cord hemangioblastoma include syringomyelia,  enhancing  nodule,  and  enlarged feeding and draining vessels.  \n\nTwenty-five  to  thirty-eight  percent  of  patients  with  von Hippel-Lindau disease will develop renal cell carcinoma, which may be multiple  and bilateral.   Pheochromocytoma is found in 10% of patients with this disease.\n\nOther  lesions  in  von  Hippel-Lindau  disease include angiomas of the liver and kidney and cysts of  the  pancreas,  liver,  kidney  and epididymis.  \n\nRoutine  screening  of  family  members  of  a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease has been  recommended.    MRI  with  Gd-DTPA  is  the procedure of choice to screen for CNS involvement.\n\nIn  the  adult, the  differential diagnosis for a cystic mass in the posterior fossa includes a simple arachnoid cyst or  a  cerebellar astrocytoma.    A  simple  arachnoid  cyst  is extra- axial and will not demonstrate an enhancing  nodule,  although  such  a  nodule  may  be  seen  in  a cerebellar  astrocytoma.  Since 40% of cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be solid, this lesion should be included in the differential of a solid or partially solid mass  in  the  posterior  fossa  in  the adult.  These lesions   are   uncommon   in   children, and medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or astrocytoma are more likely than a cerebellar hemangioblastoma when a posterior fossa mass is seen in a child.",

One of the most important of these is \"lateralization\" of speech functions to the \"dominant\" cerebral hemisphere.\n\nThe \"gold standard\" for lateralization of motor speech function is the \"Wada test\". This is performed by an injection into the carotid artery of sodium amobarbital - if speech functions are depressed, you have injected the \"speech dominant\" hemisphere.  \n\nThis procedure was first documented by Dr. Juhn Atsushi Wada, a Japanese-Canadian Neurosurgeon born in 1924; and, it is named for him - the Wada Test.\nSources - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=11624159&dopt=Abstract, http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/3132.html, http://www.epilepsy.com/epilepsy/surgery_wada.html\n\nLesions of the speech-dominant hemisphere may produce combinations of\"\n\u2022  Broca Expressive (motor) aphasia - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?itool=pubmed_Abstract&db=pubmed&cmd=Display&dopt=pubmed_pubmed&from_uid=16881250\n\u2022  Wernicke Receptive (sensory) aphasia - http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Search&db=PubMed&term=wernicke+sensory+aphasia&tool=QuerySuggestion\n\nMany researchers are trying using fMRI to replace the arterial injection used for the Wada test.  Source - http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=321227\n\nThe Wada test may be inconclusive, since some patients need and use both hemispheres for speech function.

This patient presented with only persistent cough despite evidence of intraspinal extension.  This is not unexpected given that about one half of cases are discovered incidentally on chest films.\n\nClassic radiologic findings of thoracic neuroblastoma are demonstrated.

Splaying of the ribs is a clue to the diagnosis of neuroblastoma in this case. \n\nPlain films are sensitive in suggesting the diagnosis, while MRI is the best modality for evaluating extent of disease.

These typically present as a posterior mediastinal mass at a median age of 0.9 years.  Other tumors arising from sympathetic ganglia include ganglioneuroblastoma and ganglioneuroma, which more commonly occur in older children.\n\nThe clinical presentation of thoracic neuroblastoma is characterized by a variety of symptoms and signs, including fever, malaise, back pain, anemia, and respiratory symptoms such as cough and shortness of breath.  Apical lesions may produce Horner's syndrome, and spinal canal involvement may cause lower limb weakness.  Rarely, patients may present with the opsoclonus cerebellar ataxia syndrome. That being said, approximately 50% of thoracic neuroblastomas are found incidentally on chest films. \n\nChest radiographs demonstrate a posterior mediastinal mass, which may be mistaken for pneumonia, atelectasis, or normal thymus. Rib erosion and costal separation may be evident. Calcification is often present and metastatic tumors are most often bilateral, paravertebral, and in the lower posterior mediastinum.  Computed tomography typically shows an inhomogeneously enhancing paraspinal mass. Approximately 40% of lesions show calcification, and extradural extension occurs in approximately 20%.  MRI is valuable in determining intraspinal extension, marrow involvement,  and chest wall and lymph node involvement.\n\nDiagnosis is made with biopsy of the lesion, and complete surgical resection is the treatment of choice.  Compared to abdominal neuroblastoma, thoracic neuroblastoma presents at an earlier age and stage, and is associated with a more favorable 4-year survival rate (58% versus 48%).",

The large majority of lesions are rounded or lobulated, denser than surrounding brain and generally homogenous with occasional cystic regions or central necrosis. Also a probable choice in this case due to the presence of the above characteristics.\n\n2) Ependymoma- a relatively uncommon tumor arising within the fourth ventricle, which is therefore obliterated, resembles a medulloblastoma in that it is hyperdense and homogenous. Calcification suggests ependymoma and hydrocephalus is usually marked. Possible here as all of the findings of ependymoma are present except for calcification.\n\n3) Cerebellar astrocytomas- most common type of primary intracranial al tumor found in the posterior fossa, usually show low attenuation lying in one cerebellar hemisphere, but midline position is not uncommon. Not likely here due to the high attenuation relative to surrounding brain.\n\n4) Meningioma- occur in the cerebello-pontine angle and may be confused wish acoustic neuromas, grow over the cerebellar convexity, particularly at its lateral angle.  They enhance markedly.  Also unlikely here due to the midline position of to lesion, the obstructive hydrocephalus, and the anterior shift of the brain stem with fourth ventricle obliteration.\n\n5) Hemangioblastoma - may be solitary or multiple. less commonly as part of the von Hippel-Lindau syndrome with eye, brain and cord involvement, usually in the cerebellar hemispheres, hypodense on non-contrast study with marked enhancement with contrast. Unlikely here as well since the lesion was hyperdense before enhancement.\n\n6) Dermoid tumor - heterogeneous tumor with mixed soft tissue and bone density, uncommon in the posterior fossa- unlikely due to relative homogeneity of the lesion.\n\n7) Colloid cyst - existence of which is debated in the fourth ventricle, (usually present in the third ventricle at  the posterior margin of the foramen of Monroe), present as hypodense lesions, not likely with this hyperdense lesion, far too big.\n\n8) Metastases- form the most common type of cerebellar tumor seen in adults, usually in the hemispheres, with mild hydrocephalus Unlikely here due to the patient's age, prior excellent health, location of the tumor and the severe hydrocephalus.\n\n9) Choroid plexus papilloma- exceedingly rare, and the choroid is normal on contrast study."

            "Disease Discussion": "Pathology: Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory process of the bowel that can affect any part of the GI tract from the mouth to the anus. It is likely multifactoral including  genetic influence, dysfunctional immune response, enteric normal flora bacteria, and other environmental factors.  It is believed to be the result of an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Most cases involve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Crohn disease typically affects the bowel asymmetrically, involving the mesenteric side more severely than the antimesenteric border. Although any area of the GI system may be affected, the most common site of disease is the ileo-cecal region, followed by the colon.  Microscopically, the initial lesion appears as a focal inflammatory infiltrate around the crypts, followed by ulceration of superficial mucosa, then by deeper invasion and non-caseating granulomas. Grossly, the early abnormality is hyperemia and edema of the involved mucosa. Later, superficial ulcers form, which become deep serpentine linear ulcers located both longitudinally and transversely giving the mucosa a \u201ccobblestone\u201d appearance. The lesions are often segmental; being separated by healthy areas, hence the term \u201cskip lesions\u201d. Transmural inflammation results in thickening of the bowel wall and narrowing of the lumen. As the disease progresses, it is complicated by obstruction, fistula formation, abscess formation, adhesions, and malabsorption.\n\nClinical: The characteristic presentation of Crohn disease is with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which may be complicated by intestinal fistula formation, obstruction, or both. Unpredictable flares and remissions with a long course characterize Crohn\u2019s. Treatment is generally medical including antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, and sometimes antibiotics. Chronic complications include fistulas, adhesions, and marked luminal narrowing with partial bowel obstruction which may require surgery.\n\nRadiographic findings:\nRadiological evaluation includes diagnosis, evaluation of distribution, and evaluation for complications. The distribution of small bowel Crohn\u2019s disease is best assessed by enteroclysis and CT. The terminal ileum is nearly always involved in small bowel disease and is the only site in up 30 % of patients.\n  \nSmall bowel contrast studies: The sensitivity of enteroclysis is reported as very good in detecting Crohn\u2019s disease but often does not correlate well with disease activity. Superficial abnormalities include thickened folds due to mucosal edema, transverse and longitudinal ulcers, punctate collections of barium, and small nodules. Transmural abnormalities include deep fissures and penetrating ulcers.  Cobblestoning results from intersecting longitudinal and transverse ulcers with intervening heaped-up edematous tissue.  Deep ulcerations may result in fistulae. Thickened bowel may appear as separations of loops. Luminal narrowing is always present resulting from spasm and edema during the acute phase or fibrotic strictures in chronic disease. Ileitis can also manifest as a \u201csting sign\u201d on barium study secondary to spasm or fibrotic stricture fromation.  The mesenteric aspect and adjacent mesentery are commonly affected more than the antimesenteric border. Extramural mesenteric inflammation and abscesses may induce compression and displacement of bowel loops.\n\nCross sectional imaging: Both CT and MR imaging are reported to have a sensitivity of over 95% for the detection of Crohn disease.  At more advanced stages, CT and MR imaging can help identify and characterize pathologically altered bowel segments as well as extraluminal lesions including abscesses, fat stranding, and adenopathy.  Cross sectional imaging can also clearly depict inflammatory lesions and conditions that require elective gastrointestinal surgery, aiding in treatment planning.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Myelolipoma is an uncommon, benign, nonfunctioning neoplasm of the adrenal, found in less than 1% of population based on autopsy series. It is composed of variable amounts of fat and hematopoietic tissue, including myeloid and erythroid cells and megakaryocytes.  The imaging appearance is based on the fat content of this lesion.  Thus they appear echogenic on US, low attenuation on CT and hyperintense on T1 weighted in phase MR images. The etiology is unclear, but myelolipoma may be a result of metaplasia of cells in the adrenal, possibly myeloid cells misplaced during embryogenesis. It affects men and women equally. Although this is a nonfunctioning tumor, in 10% it is associated with endocrine disorders, including Cushing syndrome, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and Conn syndrome. Most myelolipomas (80%) are asymptomatic and are of no clinical significance. Some (10%) become large and cause vague symptoms or pain. Large myelolipomas may hemorrhage, which can be the cause of pain. Size ranges from 1 to 15 cm, with a mean of about 4 cm. \n\nOn CT, most myelolipomas are well-circumscribed masses. Nearly all contain some definite fat density (<-20 HU). However, the amount of fat is widely variable, ranging from nearly all fat, to more than half fat (50%), to only a few tiny foci of fat in a soft-tissue mass (10%).  Occasionally, the mass has an attenuation value between that of fat and water because the fat and myeloid elements are diffusely mixed. Calcification is seen in 30%, often punctate. With hemorrhage, high density areas can be seen. Bilateral myelolipomas occur in about 10%. \n\nThe presence of fat in an adrenal mass is the key to the diagnosis of myelolipoma, because virtually no other adrenal lesion contains fat. Teratoma and liposarcoma of the adrenals are extraordinarily rare.  Macroscopic fat on CT (HU= -30 to -110), usually obviates the need for biopsy, but if necessary (i.e. extra-adrenal location which may then mimic a liposarcoma), diagnosis can be confirmed by percutaneous needle sampling. A definite diagnosis is important because surgical resection is not indicated unless there has been significant hemorrhage. In nearly all cases, a diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma can be made confidently based on CT findings alone.",

            "Discussion": "This radiographic finding was noted immediately following embolization of the patient's Vein of Galen (VOG) malformation using the liquid embolic agent, Onyx.  Onyx is a relatively new material composed of an ethylene-vinyl alcohol copolymer, DMSO, and tantalum.  Tantalum provides the radio-opaque property for intraoperative visualization and accounts for the appearance on this patients chest radiograph.\n\nRelatively little formal analysis of the efficacy and safety of the use of Onyx in the treatment intracerebral AVM's has been conducted.  A study by Van Rooij et al, revealed an average of 75% reduction in the volume of AVM's with a complication rate of 13.6%.  Jahan et al reported similar numbers of 63% and 26%, respectively.  While post-embolization headaches were reported, the majority of collected and reported problems involved hemorrhagic complications.  Such complications are postulated to be secondary to physiologic changes in the regional cerebral blood flow surrounding the perinidal tissues.  Proposed solutions to such complications include possible staged emobolization procedures such to produce less-drastic changes in flow dynamics.\n\nWhile no instances of symptomatic pulmonary embolism(PE) were reported in these investigations, symptomatic pulmonary embolism is a serious potential consequence of accidental peripheral emobolization.  As in this patient\u2019s case, the risk of symptomatic PE is likely lower if only small volumes of the embolic agent migrate to the pulmonary vasculature.  This is a risk that may be mitigated with careful technique and intraoperative observation.\n\nReferences\nVan Rooij et al, Brain AVM Embolization with Onyx.\nAmerican Journal of Neuroradiology. 28:172-177, January 2007\n\nJahan et al, Embolization of Arteriovenous Malformations with Onyx: Clinicopathological Experience in 23 Patients.\nNeurosurgery. 48(5):984-997, May 2001"

            "Disease Discussion": "The vein of Galen is a short but large diameter vein that drains the paired internal cerebral veins and the two basal veins of Rosenthal into the straight sinus. It is just posterior to the pineal gland, in the quadrigeminal plate cistern. This vein probably arises from remnants of the posterior median prosencephalic vein of Markowski.\n\nBy tradition, an aneurysmal enlargement of a midline venous structure in this location has been called a \"Vein of Galen Aneurysm\". However, the true origin of this dilated vascular structure is probably persistence of the anterior portion of the median prosencephalic vein (ProsV) of Markowski.  In many patients with this malformation, there is no \"classic\" vein of Galen; and, often, there is no straight sinus.  Instead, the dilated remnant of the ProsV drains into upward directed \"falcine sinus\".\n\nThese lesions most often result from vascular shunts developing between the early choroidal arteries and the deep or midline veins, during the  6th to 11th week of gestation. At this time in development, the brain is primarily supplied by multiple choroidal arteries, then - later - the circle of Willis.\n\nThese AV shunts persist, preventing involution of the anterior prosencephalic vein.  A persistent falcine vein is often present, that drains the ProsV into the straight sinus or superior sagittal sinus.\n\nVein Of Galen Malformation Symptoms, Signs\n\u2022  Childhood\n\u00bb High Output Failure\n\u00bb Persistent Ductus \n\u00bb Hydrocephalus\n\u00bb Cranial Bruit/Thrill\n\u2022  Adult\n\u00bb Asymptomatic \n\u00bb Pineal Symptoms\n \n \n\u2022  Vein Of Galen Malformation Types/Causes\n\u00bb Parenchymal AVM (Shunt)\n\u00bb Direct Fistulae To VOG\n\u00bb Dural Fistula Draining into VOG\n\u00bb Sinus Thrombosis (Intrauterine)\n\u00bb Hypoplastic Straight Sinus\n \n \n\u2022  Hydrocephalus is very common in childhood\n\u00bb Mechanical\n  - Aqueductal Obstruction from compression of tectum\n\u00bb Impaired CSF Resorption\n  - Venous Hypertension\n \n\nUoR Teaching File - http://www.urmc.rochester.edu/smd/Rad/neurocases/Neurocase06.htm",

It is thought to occur with plueral invagination due to acute atelectasis or effusion.  Then there is a fibrinous adhesion of the adjacent pleural surfaces.  The lung then folds in on itself as the acute inciting event resolves.  Signs of round atelectasis are plureal thickening, a pulmonary mass, and bronchi and blood vessels leading a curvilinear path from the hilum to the mass (\u201ccomet tail sign\u201d).

            "Disease Discussion": "Chance fractures, first described by G.Q. Chance in 1948, are horizontal vertebral fractures that extend through the vertebral body, pedicles and  to the spinous process or lamina.   The plain films are characteristic of wedge compression fractures while the posterior components are displaced to varying degrees.  The posterior displacements are often better visualized on MRI and more specifically CT.  CT with sagittal reconstructions are recommended.  \n\nChance fractures commonly occur at the thoracic/lumbar junction where the spine transitions from a rigid to a more flexible segment.  The etiology of these fractures is most often hyperflexion of the back.  With the increasing use of lap seat belts in the 1950s-70s these fractures became known as \u201cseat belt\u201d fractures as vehicle accidents would cause sudden flexion of the waist at the thoracic/lumbar junction inducing significant stress on the posterior column.  With the addition of shoulder belts these injuries have become significantly less common.  Most Chance fractures seen today are a result of falls or crush type injuries where the spine is acutely hyperflexed.  Intraabdominal injuries are likely in approximately 50% of chance fractures so vigilance should be given to a thorough evaluation involving a CT of the abdomen.  \n\nMost Chance Fractures are managed with immobilization.  Instability is frequently associated with a kyphosis of 20\u00b0 or more and a kyphosis of 30\u00b0 or more usually requires internal stabilization.  Main treatment for unstable fractures is surgical fixation with spinal canal decompression.",

METHODS: All admissions with the diagnosis of suspected\nmethanol toxicity were analysed and the current guidelines for the management of\nthis problem were reviewed. RESULTS: Twenty-four subjects were identified. Most\nhad a history of chronic use of methylated spirits. Four died before admission\nto hospital and the other 20 patients had 26 admissions to hospital and form the\nbasis for this report. Four patients died in the Intensive Care Unit. In total\n11 patients were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. Seven patients received\nhaemodialysis. There was no correlation between the methanol level and the\noutcome. The strongest predictor of death or a poor outcome was a blood pH <\n7.0. Some patients, in spite of potentially lethal methanol levels of up to 160\nmmol/L, did not develop signs of toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The overall mortality\nwas high and ethanol was given to most of the patients for up to several days.\nSome patients did not show any toxicity and some of those were not given\nethanol. It is recommended that chronic meths drinkers, who are not acidaemic\nand are generally well, do not require ethanol treatment.

One patient underwent extensive electrophysiological and\npsychophysical testing. RESULTS: Both patients reported transient visual\ndisturbances. In each patient vision was 6/6 in both eyes at presentation but\nsubsequently improved to 6/4. Colour vision (Ishihara plates) and pupillary\nreactions were normal. The optic discs were hyperaemic and swollen and retinal\noedema extended along the major vascular arcades. There was cystoid macular\noedema and 'pseudo cherry red spots' were observed. Automated field analysis\nrevealed a generalized depression of retinal sensitivity, an enlargement of one\nblind spot and paracentral scotomas. The scotopic ERG was subnormal with\ndiminished a- and b-waveforms and the cone response to flicker was reduced. The\npattern VER P2 waveform was normal in latency but decreased in amplitude.\nCONCLUSIONS: Acute methanol ingestion can cause characteristic ocular damage,\ntogether with widespread electrophysiological dysfunction.

The rate at which rodents detoxify formate is more rapid than\nthat of primates. Formate, an endogenous biological substrate, is detoxified by\nmetabolism to CO2 via a tetrahydrofolate-(THF) dependent pathway. Species with\nhigh hepatic THF levels, such as rodents, are less sensitive to the neurotoxic\neffects of large methanol doses compared with species with low THF levels, such\nas primates. Data on the capacity of primates to detoxify formate derived from\ninhalation of low levels of methanol are critical for assessing human risk from\nmethanol fuels. Female cynomolgus monkeys exposed to low concentrations of\n[14C]methanol (10-200 ppm) for 2 h have blood levels of methanol-derived formate\nthat are 100- to 1000-fold lower than endogenous levels of formate. Healthy\nhuman volunteers exposed at rest or during exercise to 200 ppm methanol for 6 h\nor exposed to 20 mg/kg orally have elevated blood levels of methanol, but blood\nformate concentrations are not significantly increased above endogenous\nconcentrations. Deficiencies in THF may prolong blood levels of formate and\nincrease the likelihood of toxic effects. Limited studies in non-human primates\nwith low THF levels exposed to 900 ppm methanol for 2 h have shown that\nconcentrations of methanol-derived formate in blood remain below endogenous\nlevels. Thus human populations may not be at added risk of neurotoxic effects\nresulting from exposure to low levels of methanol.\n\nPublication Types:\nReview\nReview, Tutorial\n\nPMID: 8597130 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n\n8: J Toxicol Environ Health  1994 Jan;41(1):71-82 \n\nAnimal model for the study of methanol toxicity: comparison of folate-reduced\nrat responses with published monkey data.\n\nLee EW, Garner CD, Terzo TS.\n\nBiomedical Science Department, General Motors North American Operations, Warren,\nMichigan 48090-9055.\n\nWe attempted to develop a rodent model that exhibits characteristics of human\nmethanol toxicities such as acidosis and visual dysfunction, which are\ncorrelated with an accumulation of formate, a toxic metabolite of methanol.\nInitially three groups of Long-Evans rats with different levels of liver folate\nwere prepared and examined for formate accumulation after methanol\nadministration (3.5 g/kg). The folate-reduced (FR) rats prepared by feeding a\nfolate-deficient diet with 1% succinylsulfathiazole yielded blood formate levels\nequivalent to those found in methanol-intoxicated humans and developed signs of\nthe visual system toxicity (a manuscript on the latter aspect is in\npreparation). Responses of FR rats to a variety of methanol exposure scenarios\nwere then investigated, and the results were compared with those reported in the\nliterature for monkeys. Formate accumulation and/or lethality were used as toxic\nparameters for this comparative evaluation. In FR rats dosed orally with 3 g/kg,\nthe blood formate concentration was 9.2 mmol/L at 24 h postadministration and\nincreased to 15.6 mmol/L at 48 h. The same dose given to monkeys yielded a\nplateau of 7.4 mmol/L at 12 h after methanol administration, and stayed at this\nlevel for an additional 12 h. The area under the concentration vs. time curve\nfor blood formate in FR rats was 2.5-fold greater than that in monkeys when 2.0\ng/kg methanol was administered. After a 6-h exposure to 1200 ppm and 2000 ppm\nmethanol, the blood formate concentrations in FR rats were increased by 370% and\n636% above the endogenous level, respectively. However, blood formate did not\naccumulate above the endogenous level when monkeys were exposed to methanol up\nto 2000 ppm for 6 h. Under acute inhalation exposure conditions, FR rats exposed\nto 3000 ppm methanol, 20 h/d, could not survive more than 4 d. On the other\nhand, monkeys exposed to 3000 ppm, 21 h/d, out-lived 20 d. Moreover, monkeys\nsurvived for more than 4 d even after an exposure to 10,000 ppm. Thus, these\nresults indicate that FR rats are more sensitive to methanol challenges than\nmonkeys, and suggest that the FR rat could be a congruous animal model for\nevaluating the health effects of methanol in humans.\n\nPMID: 8277527 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n\n9: Am Fam Physician  1993 Jan;47(1):163-71 \n\nComment in:\n Am Fam Physician. 1993 Oct;48(5):731.\n\nMethanol toxicity. Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry.\n\nMethanol is used in a variety of commercial and consumer products. Increased use\nof methanol as a motor fuel may lead to higher ambient air levels and a greater\npotential for ingestion from siphoning accidents. Methanol toxicity initially is\nnot characterized by severe toxic manifestations. Pathophysiologically, methanol\ntoxicity represents a classic example of \"lethal synthesis,\" in which toxic\nmetabolites can cause fatality after a characteristic latent period. Methanol is\nwell absorbed following inhalation, ingestion or cutaneous exposure. It is\noxidized in the liver to formaldehyde, then to formic acid, which contributes to\nthe profound metabolic acidosis occurring in acute methanol poisoning. The\nmetabolic products of methanol can produce a syndrome of delayed-onset acidosis,\nobtundation, visual disturbance and death. Intravenous sodium bicarbonate\ntherapy should be considered if the patient's blood pH is below 7.2. Symptoms\nand history determine whether intravenous ethanol therapy and hemodialysis\nshould be instituted.\n\nPublication Types:\nReview\nReview, Tutorial\n\nPMID: 8418579 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n\n10: Aust N Z J Ophthalmol  1992 Feb;20(1):57-64 \n\nPartly reversible visual failure with methanol toxicity.\n\nStelmach MZ, O'Day J.\n\nSt Vincent's Hospital, Fitzroy, Victoria, Australia.\n\nMethanol is a highly toxic substance which is used as an industrial solvent and\nin automotive antifreeze.

A rodent model with structural and functional evidence for\nretinal involvement.\n\nMurray TG, Burton TC, Rajani C, Lewandowski MF, Burke JM, Eells JT.\n\nDepartment of Ophthalmology, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee 53226.\n\nMethanol ingestion can lead to visual impairment, central nervous system\ndysfunction, or death. The extent of ocular involvement has been difficult to\ndetermine because the toxicity is restricted to humans and nonhuman primates due\nto species differences in methanol metabolism. A rodent model of methanol\ntoxicity recently developed by us was used to evaluate retinal dysfunction in\nmethanol poisoning. Formic acidemia and visual toxic reactions developed in\nmethanol-intoxicated rats. Electroretinographic analysis indicated a significant\nearly deficit in b-wave amplitude followed by a temporally delayed, lesser\nreduction in a-wave amplitude. Histologic evaluation of the eyes 60 hours after\nmethanol administration revealed generalized retinal edema and vacuolation in\nthe photoreceptors and retinal pigment epithelium. Ultrastructural examination\nshowed swelling and disruption of the mitochondria in photoreceptor inner\nsegments, optic nerve, and the retinal pigment epithelium. These studies\ndocument direct retinal involvement in this nonprimate model of methanol\ntoxicity.\n\nPMID: 2064555 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n\n12: Life Sci  1991;48(11):1031-41 \n\nThe toxicity of methanol.\n\nTephly TR.\n\nDepartment of Pharmacology, University of Iowa, Iowa City 52242.\n\nMethanol toxicity in humans and monkeys is characterized by a latent period of\nmany hours followed by a metabolic acidosis and ocular toxicity. This is not\nobserved in most lower animals. The metabolic acidosis and blindness is\napparently due to formic acid accumulation in humans and monkeys, a feature not\nseen in lower animals. The accumulation of formate is due to a deficiency in\nformate metabolism which is, in turn, related, in part, to low hepatic\ntetrahydrofolate (H4 folate). An excellent correlation between hepatic H4 folate\nand formate oxidation rates has been shown within and across species. Thus,\nhumans and monkeys possess low hepatic H4 folate levels, low rates of formate\noxidation and accumulation of formate after methanol. Formate, itself, produces\nblindness in monkeys in the absence of metabolic acidosis. In addition to low\nhepatic H4 folate concentrations, monkeys and humans also have low hepatic\n10-formyl H4 folate dehydrogenase levels, the enzyme which is the ultimate\ncatalyst for conversion of formate to carbon dioxide. This review presents the\nbasis for the role of folic acid-dependent reactions in the regulation of\nmethanol toxicity.\n\nPublication Types:\nReview\nReview, Academic\n\nPMID: 1997785 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n\n13: Med Toxicol  1986 Sep-Oct;1(5):309-34 \n\nMethanol and ethylene glycol poisonings. Mechanism of toxicity, clinical course,\ndiagnosis and treatment.\n\nJacobsen D, McMartin KE.\n\nMethanol and ethylene glycol poisonings share many characteristics both\nclinically and biochemically. Both alcohols are metabolised via alcohol\ndehydrogenase to their toxic metabolites. Methanol is slowly metabolised to\nformaldehyde which is rapidly metabolised to formate, the metabolite mainly\nresponsible for methanol toxicity. Formate metabolism depends upon the folate\npool which is small in primates compared with other animals. Therefore, formate\naccumulates in primates during methanol intoxication and is mainly responsible\nfor the metabolic acidosis in the early stage of intoxication. In late stages\nlactate may also accumulate, mainly due to formate inhibition of the respiratory\nchain. This tissue hypoxia caused by formate may explain the ocular as well as\nthe general toxicity. Ethylene glycol is metabolised more rapidly than methanol,\nvia alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolaldehyde which is rapidly metabolised to\nglycolate, the metabolite mainly responsible for the metabolic acidosis in\nethylene glycol poisoning. Glycolate is metabolised by various pathways,\nincluding one to oxalate which rapidly precipitates with calcium in various\ntissues and in the urine. Ethylene glycol toxicity is complex and not fully\nunderstood, but is mainly due to the severe metabolic acidosis caused by\nglycolate and to the calcium oxalate precipitation. The clinical course in both\npoisonings is initially characterised by the development of metabolic acidosis\nfollowing a latent period, which is more pronounced in methanol poisoning and is\nthe time taken for both alcohols to be metabolised to their toxic metabolites.\nIn methanol poisoning there are usually visual symptoms progressing to visual\nimpairment, whereas ethylene glycol victims develop renal and cardiopulmonary\nfailure. Prognosis is excellent in both poisonings provided that there is early\ntreatment with alkali to combat acidosis, ethanol as an antimetabolite, and\nhaemodialysis to remove the alcohols and their toxic metabolites. Ethanol is\nalso metabolised by alcohol dehydrogenase, but has a much higher affinity for\nthis enzyme than methanol and ethylene glycol. Presence of ethanol will\ntherefore inhibit formation of toxic metabolites from methanol and ethylene\nglycol. Due to competition for the enzyme, the therapeutic ethanol concentration\ndepends on the concentration of the other two alcohols, but a therapeutic\nethanol concentration around 22 mmol/L (100 mg/dl) is generally recommended.\nMost patients are, however, admitted at a late stage to hospitals not capable of\nperforming analyses of these alcohols or their specific metabolites on a 24-hour\nbasis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)\n\nPublication Types:\nReview\n\nPMID: 3537623 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n\n14: J Emerg Med  1983;1(1):51-8 \n\nMethanol poisoning.\n\nBecker CE.\n\nMethanol poisoning is an uncommon but an extremely hazardous intoxication. Since\nmethanol is a versatile fuel and is having increasing usage in an\nenergy-conscious society, a high index of suspicion and swift laboratory\nconfirmation is essential in managing this poisoning. Methanol poisoning may\noccur in sporadic or epidemic circumstances. Chronic exposure may occur in the\noccupational setting. Man is uniquely susceptible to methanol toxicity, perhaps\ndependent upon folate metabolism. Classic symptoms of methanol toxicity can only\noccur in laboratory animals who are rendered folate deficient. Folate may be\nuseful in humans enhancing removal of the toxic products of methanol poisoning.\nThe enzyme responsible for metabolism of methanol is alcohol dehydrogenase.\nEthanol has a higher affinity for this enzyme and is preferentially metabolized.\nSimultaneous ethanol and methanol administration may confuse the onset of the\nintoxication. Pyrazoles may also be used to inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase thus\npreventing the intoxication. The most important initial symptom of methanol\npoisoning is visual disturbance. The symptoms may be delayed up to 24 hours\nafter ingestion due to simultaneous alcohol administration and metabolic\nprocesses. Laboratory evidence of severe metabolic acidosis with increased anion\nand osmolar gaps strongly suggest the clinical diagnosis. There may be an\nimportant association between mean corpuscular volume which is significantly\nhigher in cases of severe methanol poisoning than in mild cases.(ABSTRACT\nTRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)\n\nPublication Types:\nReview\n\nPMID: 6386968 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]\n\n\n\n15: Am J Med  1980 Mar;68(3):414-8 \n\nMethanol poisoning in human subjects. Role for formic acid accumulation in the\nmetabolic acidosis.\n\nMcMartin KE, Ambre JJ, Tephly TR.\n\nWhereas a great deal of information is available on the etiology of methanol\npoisoning in the monkey, very little study has been made in human subjects. The\nrole of formic acid in methanol toxicity in human subjects has not been\nestablished. Two patients have been studied who have presented with the\ncharacteristics of methanol poisoning--metabolic acidosis and ocular toxicity.\nThis has made possible a confirmation of the role of formate in the toxic\nsyndrome. Acidosis was very severe in both cases with arterial pH values of\nabout 6.9 and plasma bicarbonate concentrations of 3 meq/liter. A sensitive and\nspecific assay was used to measure formic acid levels in blood and other fluids.\nFormate accumulation was marked with initial blood levels ranging from 11.1 to\n26.0 meq/liter. Decreases in blood bicarbonate concentrations of similar\nmagnitude coincided with the increase in formate. Thus, accumulation of formic\nacid plays a major part in the acidosis observed in human subjects poisoned with\nmethanol, as has been demonstrated in monkeys. Treatment involving bicarbonate\nadministration, ethanol infusion and hemodialysis, rapidly decreased formate\nlevels in the blood to control values. Methanol concentrations were reduced but\nto lesser extent than that of formate. Despite the reduction in formate and\nmethanol concentrations in both cases, the treatment was successful in only one\nof the two patients.\n\nPMID: 7361809 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]",

            "Disease Discussion": "Synovial sarcoma is an uncommon variant of the soft tissue sarcomas, occuring in less than 10% of adult cases. Although the typical clinical presentation is a young adult with a painless rapidly growing extremity mass (80-95%of patients), there is a wide age variation with most common age group being the 15-35 year age group. Besides the extremities, primary synovial sarcomas have been described throughout the body to include the heart, brain, and abdomen.\n\nSarcomas are classified according to the tissue they most closely resemble, as such, synovial sarcoma is classically described as a having a biphasic fibrous spindle cell population admixed with an epitheliod component. They likely originate from genetic mutations in totipotent mesenchymal cells, which may explain variations in histologic and anatomic presentation as well as the clinical course of the neoplasm. The translocation t(X:18) is present in greater than 90% of synovial sarcomas.\n\nRadiographs of these patients may be nomral in one-half of patients. Thirty percent of masses shows calcification or less commonly ossification.  In 11-20% of patients, bony erosion of the adjacent bone can be seen.  Both CT and MRI can show areas of necrotic or hemoorhage that appear as aresa of low attenuation on CT images and high attenuation on T2-weighted MR images. Both modalities can demonstrate a multilobulated lesion with septation. Fluid-fluid levels may be seen in areas of hemorrhage. For staging of tumors, MRI is the best modality.  The histologic and chromosomal findings described above are often the key to diagnosis.\n\nTreatment for all synovial sarcomas is resection. According to a retrospective study performed by Ferrari et al, primary synovial sarcoma with clear margins and no evidence of metastases carries a 5-year overall survival of greater than 70%(1). That rate decreases to less than 40% with locally advanced disease. Unfortunately, nearly 60% of those with macroscopically resected disease developed metastases within 5 years (primarily to the lungs and liver). Nearly 40% of patients also receiving chemotherapy (doxyrubicin, cyclophosphamide, and occasionally cisplatin) developed metastases within 5 years (1).",

            "Title": "Intestinal Malrotation",
            "Disease Discussion": "Malrotation is a congenital anomaly of midgut development. In the fifth week of normal embryonic development the midgut rapidly elongates, forming the primary intestinal loop. The vascular supply to the midgut, the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), serves as the axis for the primary intestinal loop. The primary intestinal loop elongates so rapidly that the abdominal cavity cannot contain the developing midgut; and, as a result, the primary intestinal loop herniates into the umbilical cord. During this herniation, the developing loop rotates 90 degrees counterclockwise about its axis. In the tenth week of development, the intestinal loop returns to the abdominal cavity, rotating an additional 180 degrees counterclockwise. \n\nThe cephalic limb of the primary loop forms the distal duodenum, the jejunum, and the proximal ileum. The caudal limb forms the distal ileum, the cecum, ascending colon, and most of the transverse colon. \n\nThe proximal or pre-arterial midgut returns to the abdominal cavity first and begins to occupy the right side of the abdominal cavity. The proximal midgut becomes fixed to the posterior abdominal wall at the ligament of Treitz.\n\nAs the distal or post-arterial midgut returns to the abdomen, the counterclockwise rotation causes the cecum to initially occupy the right upper quadrant. The rotation is completed as the cecum migrates to the right iliac fossa in the right lower quadrant (RLQ). \n\nThe ascending colon gradually becomes fixed to the posterior abdominal wall, losing its free mesentery. Normal counterclockwise rotation of the midgut results in a wide-based mesentery. In malrotation, the proximal midgut returns to the abdominal cavity with normal rotation, but the distal midgut fails to rotate completely. As a result, the cecum will become fixed to the posterior abdominal wall in the upper abdomen. This position results in a mesentery with a narrow base that is prone to volvulus and midgut ischemia. \n\nPeritoneal bands of fibrosis that fix the cecum to the right lateral abdominal wall (Ladd\u2019s bands) run anterior to the duodenum and may cause compression and obstruction of the duodenum.\n\nSymptomatic malrotation typically presents in infancy or childhood. The acute symptomatic presentation is usually related to duodenal obstruction or midgut ischemia.  Although it is less common, intestinal malrotation may first become symptomatic in adolescence or adulthood. The later onset of symptoms ranges from chronic abdominal pain to acute mesenteric ischemia. Occasionally, malrotation is discovered as an incidental radiographic finding. \n\nThe management of asymptomatic malrotation is controversial. Some authors have suggested that all asymptomatic patients with malrotation should undergo an open or laparoscopic Ladd\u2019s procedure (transaction of Ladd\u2019s bands, counterclockwise reduction of malrotation, and appendectomy). Others have proposed that prophylactic surgical intervention is only indicated in children with asymptomatic malrotation. \n\nThe prevalence of asymptomatic malrotation is unknown. As the use of of computed tomography increases and new abdominal imaging modalities emerge, it is likely that the diagnosis of intestinal malrotation as an incidental finding will become more frequent.",

            "Discussion": "This patient had an atypical presentation for stroke, without any of the classic risk factors.  While it is true that headaches are sometimes seen with stroke, this patient had no focal neurologic findings at the time of his presentation, which confused the picture.  His headache presentation was most consistent with migraine, if one assumes a primary headache.  If one looks further for causes of secondary headache, the differential includes subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), aneurysm, acute ischemic cerebrovascular disorder, arteritis, artery dissection, hypertension(HTN), pseudotumor cerebri, infection, and substance use or withdrawal.  \n\tIn this case, the team did a CT for bleeding including SAH and mass effect, which was negative, blood work to rule out arteritis and infection, and (later) an MRA to examine the arteries, which was also normal everywhere but the L PICA. Physical exam and lumbar puncture ruled out pseudotumor cerebri in this case. That leaves HTN, ischemia/infarct, and substance or drug use or withdrawal.\n\tThe patient's systolic blood pressure was elevated on presentation, and with further digging, continued to remain elevated during his hospital course (with diastolic also elevated most of the time). It is possible that his blood pressure had been elevated for quite some time, leading to an occult risk factor.  If his headache was a caused by a hypertensive crisis, one would expect his blood pressure to be further elevated on presentation. \n\tThe patient was taking Effexor (venlafaxine), which is a Selective Serotonin/ Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor(SNRI), and has both HTN and headaches as possible side effects.  Stroke is not listed as a known side effect.  However, there is one case study in the literature that describes a patient having a \"migraine-like\" stroke while having a serotonin syndrome.  Serotonin syndrome is caused by too much serotonin in the brain, usually secondary to patients taking SSRIs/ SNRIs and then taking a second serotonin promoter.  It does sometimes occur when patients are taking elevated doses of medication.  It is unknown how long this patient was taking Effexor before his headaches began or if he experienced any of the other symptoms of serotonin syndrome, including acute mental status changes, involuntary movements, altered muscle tone, and autonomic instability.  Even if the patient did not have serotonin syndrome on presentation, it is worth noting that he received sumatriptan while in the hospital, while also receiving his venlafaxine.   Could this combination have precipitated a serotonin syndrome?  Certainly, however, the patient did not report an increase in symptoms after receiving the drug, so the possibility is very slim.\n\tCocaine is also associated with stroke in the younger population.  It is associated with vasoconstriction, and has been known to cause slow flow in the vertebrobasilar system (which supplies the PICA), among other cerebral infarcts, and HTN.  While this patient does not report any cocaine use, it is a possibility to be entertained.\n\tThe actual cause of this patient\u2019s infarct may never be known, in part because we do not know when the actual infarct occurred.  CT best demonstrates signs of cerebral infarct at least 24 hours after the event.  There are cases of CT being used to identify infarcts earlier, but this is generally by identifying secondary signs (like a clot in the MCA) and in the cerebrum rather than the cerebellum.   The differential for headaches is very broad, but stroke must be kept in mind especially when no other obvious cause presents itself, as it can often be reversed if found early enough.\nReferences:\nClinch,CR.

The pain was sharp, but throbbing and located behind his left eye and radiating posteriorly. The nausea and vomiting began just after lunch, and shortly after the patient took a motrin for his headache. He denied any fevers, chills, night sweats, recent ill contacts, or diarrhea. The patient was given ativan, morphine, phenergan, zofran and benadryl along with a 1L bolus of NS. CT was performed and determined to be negative for acute pathology. On day 2, the headache had resolved in the AM, but IV phenergan was required for nausea, and the dizziness persisted. The patient reported a headache in the afternoon, unresolved with 2 separate doses of Imitrex (sumatriptan), but partially alleviated with Tylenol. The patient continued to experience pain the following day, so a repeat CT was done, which showed a \u201cprobable left cerebellar infarct\u201d.\nPMHx: Hypertriglyceridemia, psoriasis, anxiety, G6PD, Crohns\nMeds: Lopid (gemfibrozil), Effexor (venlafaxine)\nAllergies: Iodine, Primaquin"

            "Disease Discussion": "Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC), also known as \u201cBourneville\u2019s disease\u201d, is a multi-organ disorder that can present in a variety of ways.  It is inherited as an autosomal-dominant trait.  Its incidence is approximately 1:10,000 to 1:50,000 (1).  The clinical presentation of tuberous sclerosis is dependent on the age of the patient, the organ systems involved, and the severity of their involvement.  Classically, however, tuberous sclerosis presents with Vogt\u2019s triad:  adenoma sebaceum (Pringle\u2019s disease), mental retardation, and seizures.  Adenoma sebaceum are angiofibromas that usually develop between the ages of 1 and 4 years.  They are usually pink or red papules that form on the face in a malar distribution, similar to the butterfly rash of SLE.  They occur in approximately 75% of tuberous sclerosis patients.    \n\nAnother common physical exam finding in tuberous sclerosis is hypopigmented macules on the trunk and extremities.  These lesions are commonly present at birth and become more noticeable as the patient ages.  At least three types of hypopigmented macules have been documented in TSC:  polygonal (most frequent), ash-leaf shaped, and confetti-shaped (multiple 1-3 mm macules) .  These hypopigmented lesions can sometimes be better seen with a Wood\u2019s lamp.   \n\nAlthough the above two physical findings are classic for TSC, there are many other physical features that are suggestive of the diagnosis (see table below).\n\nTable 1:  Major and Minor Diagnostic Features of Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (2)\n\n\u2022 \tMajor features\n\u2022 \tFacial angiofibromas or forehead plaque \n\u2022 \tNontraumatic ungual or periungual fibrom \n\u2022 \tHypomelatonic macules (three or more) \n\u2022 \tShagreen patch (connective-tissue nevus) \n\u2022 \tMultiple retinal nodular hamartomas \n\u2022 \tCortical tubera \n\u2022 \tSubependymal nodule \n\u2022 \tSubependymal giant-cell astrocytoma \n\u2022 \tCardiac rhabdomyoma, single or multiple \n\u2022 \tLymphangiomyomatosis \n\u2022 \tRenal angiomyolipoma \n\u2022 \tMinor features\n\u2022 \tMultiple, randomly distributed pits in dental enamel \n\u2022 \tHamarromatous rectal polyps \n\u2022 \tBone cysts \n\u2022 \tCerebral white matter radial migration lines \n\u2022 \tGingival fibromas \n\u2022 \tNonrenal hamartoma \n\u2022 \tRetinal achromic patch \n\u2022 \t'Confetti' skin lesions \n\u2022 \tMultiple renal cysts \n\n\u2022 \tDefinite tuberous sclerosis complex\n\u2022 \tEither two major features or one major feature plus two minor features \n\u2022 \tProbable tuberous sclerosis complex\n\u2022 \tOne major plus one minor feature \n\u2022 \tPossible tuberous sclerosis complex\n\u2022 \tEither one major feature or two or more minor features \n\u2013\tWhen cerebral cortical dysplasia and cerebral white matter migration tracts occur together, they should be counted as one rather than two features of tuberous sclerosis. \n\u2013\tWhen both lympangiomyomatosis and renal angiomyolipomas are present, other features of tuberous sclerosis should be present before a definite diagnosis is assigned. \n\u2013\tHistologic confirmation is suggested. \n\u2013\tRadiographic confirmation is sufficient. \n\u2013\tOne panel member felt strongly that three or more radial migration lines should constitute a major sign.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Hepatic injuries occur in roughly 5-10% of patients with blunt abdominal trauma; other associated visceral injuries are very common. Capsular disruption and intraperitoneal hemorrhage is often present. The mortality, which is relatively high (10-25%), is usually due to either an associated injury or an uncontrollable hemorrhage from a laceration or a central burst that involves the major hepatic veins and/or the intrahepatic or retrohepatic inferior vena cava. These latter patients rarely come to CT because of instability. Contrast-enhanced CT is the procedure of choice for evaluating hepatic injuries in stable patients. It can define the extent of injury, detect associated injuries and roughly quantitate the amount of hemoperitoneum. The amount of hemoperitoneum does not always correlate with clinical stability and the need for immediate surgery. Fairly large hepatic injuries may be missed without intravenous contrast enhancement. Conversely, small hematomas may be visible as densities on a non-contrast scan (and obscured by contrast-enhanced parenchyma). These are usually not clinically significant and preliminary non-contrast CT may be safely omitted when you are pressed for time. If non-operative management is chosen, CT or sonography can be used for follow-up. The liver injuries likely to be encountered on CT include contusions, subcapsular and parenchymal hematomas, lacerations and fractures. Contusions are ill-defined intraparenchymal lucencies. Subcapsular hematomas are lenticular lucent peripheral collections that indent the liver contour. Intraparenchymal hematomas are rounded or slightly irregular lucent collections.  Fresh and clotted blood is hyperdense on non-contrast scans as opposed to its hypodense appearance after contrast. Lacerations are linear, sometimes branching radiolucencies, referred to as burst injuries when complex and extensive. When a laceration avulses a segment or lobe it is called a fracture. \n\nPotential complications that should be sought during follow-up of a conservatively treated hepatic trauma patient or a postoperative patient include: arterial pseudoaneurysm (angiography and Doppler sonography are helpful additional studies), intra- or perihepatic abscess, biloma or biliary fistula. Radionuclide hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a sometimes helpful noninvasive adjunctive study for the latter two conditions.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Watch Video - http://youtu.be/30XPVg0DWH4\nAn epidural hematoma (EDH) is an accumulation of blood between the outer (periosteal) layer of the dura mater (literally \"tough mother\") and the naked bone of the inner table of the skull. Most patients will have an acute clinical presentation.  The blood will, therefore, be hyperdense (white) on a plain CT scan.  The most common source of bleeding is a laceration or tear in one of the meningeal arteries that feed the dura itself.  Posterior or occipital epidurals may develop from lacerations of the dural transverse sinus.\n\nMore than 90% of patients with an EDH will have a skull fracture (and associated scalp trauma) in addition to the EDH.  The temporal bone and the underlying middle cranial fossa are the most commonly affected areas. Because of the firm fixation of the dura to the suture, the hematoma only rarely crosses a cranial suture.\n\nSome patients are knocked unconscious by the initial head impact (a \"concussion\") - but then wake up and may appear normal.  This is often described as the \"lucid interval\" and occurs in about 40% of patients with epidural hematoma.\n\nDr. Paul Cooper, in his book \"Head Injury\", reports these five patterns of the clinical EDH:(U=unconscious; L=lucid; C=conscious)\n\n1. U-->L-->U: 11 to 67%\n2. U throughout: 19 to 56%\n3. U-->C: 16 to 26%\n4. C-->U: 7 to 21%\n5. C throughout: 9 to 25%\n6. unknown or unstated: 5%\n\nNOTE: A significant number of patients do not even have a transient loss of consciousness. (Data courtesy of Vern Armbrustmacher).\n\nAs the blood accumulates from bleeding meningeal arteries, it forms a bi-convex or lens shaped mass that pushes the brain inward and downward - causing brain herniation.\n\nThe acute formation of the EDH often causes secondary downward transtentorial brain herniation.  This, in turn, may cause neurologic signs,including oculomotor nerve (CNN-3) dysfunction and a \"blown pupil\" (fixed and dilated).\n\nMany patients have the injury, but appear to be alright afterwards.  As the blood accumulates and the brain begins to shift, they may slip into a coma.  This is \"lucid interval\" is also sometimes described as \"Talk and Die\".

Because the inner dural layer and the arachnoid are not firmly attached the bleeding can spread over a large area and can form a distinctive crescent shape.\n\nThese extra-axial bleeds are often the result of blunt trauma that causes the brain to shift rapidly within the skull.  Typically, it is the older population where these are most common, because cerebral atrophy can lead to more room for the brain to move, and more stress placed upon the bridging veins.  Another unique characteristics of subdural hematomas is that they will not cross the dural reflections formed by the falx cerebri and tentorim (they will cross sutural margins which helps differentiate subdual from epidural bleeds).   Also, a subdual bleed can be chronic with episodes of rebleeding which leads to a layering of blood as new bleeding occurs and old blood is being absorbed called a hematocrit effect.",

Although the disease itself has no predilection for a particular gender of race, it has been observed that the progression of the disease is accelerated in males and African Americans.  Clinically, patients often initially present with hematuria.  Physical exam may be remarkable for enlarged palpable kidneys.  As the disease progresses hypertension, polyuria, and proteinuria may develop.A number of extrarenal anomalies are associated with Adult polycystic kidney disease.   Approximately 40% of patients have polycystic liver disease and about 25% have mitral valve prolapse.   Both of these conditions are usually asymptomatic in these patients.

            "Title": "Cerebellar hemangioblastoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Cerebellar  hemangioblastomas  are benign neoplasms of vascular origin.    They are not malformations.  They account for less than 3% of all intracranial neoplasms (1).  These tumors are most common  in  young  and middle-aged  adults,  where the incidence in males exceeds that of females (2).  The cerebellar hemisphere is the most common location, although they may be located in  the  spinal  cord,  brain stem,  or cerebral  hemispheres.    Ten percent of hemangioblastomas occur as part of the von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n\nSixty percent of these tumors are cystic, as in this case.  The enhancing mural nodule is a common finding in hemangioblastoma.  At CT,  the  cystic  portion of the tumor appears low density and does not enhance, while the  mural  nodule  enhances  homogeneously  and intensely.  The  MR  findings,  as  seen  in this case, include a predominantly cystic tumor with long  T1  and  long  T2  relaxation times,  and  intense enhancement of the peripheral nodule following gadolinium administration.  If the vascular nodule has bled  or  is proteinaceous,  it  may  be  hyperintense  on  short TR precontrast sequences.  More than one  enhancing  tumor  nodule  may  be  seen. Forty  percent  of hemangioblastomas are solid and display variable degrees of contrast enhancement.\n\nLateral  projections of a left vertebral artery subtraction angiogram (arterial and venous phases) in another patient with hemangioblastoma are shown in Films .6 and .7.  The angiographic findings are characteristic for a hemangioblastoma.  Notice the focal  enhancing nodule  fed  predominantly  by  the  superior cerebellar artery and seen densely enhancing in the arterial phase.   Because of  significant  artifact  in  the  posterior  fossa on CT, a small peripheral nodule may be missed and angiography is felt to be more sensitive  than  contrast  CT scan for detecting nodules.  MRI with Gd-DTPA may replace angiography for  evaluation  of  patients  with suspected hemangioblastoma.\n\nvon  Hippel-Lindau  disease  is  an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete and variable penetrance (3).  The incidence is equal in males and females.  Multiple lesions have been reported in  this syndrome,  but  the  most important lesions which cause significant morbidity include retinal angiomatosis, cerebellar or  spinal  cord hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.  Over  50% of patients with this syndrome have hemangioblastomas of the retina, which may present with acute or  chronic  retinal  detachment.  Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals these lesions, and radiographic evaluation plays a small role.\n\nThirty-six  to sixty percent of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have cerebellar hemangioblastoma.  Signs and symptoms due  to  this tumor  are  the  most common cause for patients to present with the syndrome.\n\nAlthough  the reported occurrence of spinal cord hemangioblastoma is 5%, autopsy data  and  MRI  suggest  the  incidence  may  be higher (4,5).    Signs and symptoms of a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may be dramatic, and neurologic deficit from a spinal  cord  lesion may  be overlooked.  Typical MR findings in a spinal cord hemangioblastoma include syringomyelia,  enhancing  nodule,  and  enlarged feeding and draining vessels.  \n\nTwenty-five  to  thirty-eight  percent  of  patients  with  von Hippel-Lindau disease will develop renal cell carcinoma, which may be multiple  and bilateral.   Pheochromocytoma is found in 10% of patients with this disease.\n\nOther  lesions  in  von  Hippel-Lindau  disease include angiomas of the liver and kidney and cysts of  the  pancreas,  liver,  kidney  and epididymis.  \n\nRoutine  screening  of  family  members  of  a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease has been  recommended.    MRI  with  Gd-DTPA  is  the procedure of choice to screen for CNS involvement.\n\nIn  the  adult, the  differential diagnosis for a cystic mass in the posterior fossa includes a simple arachnoid cyst or  a  cerebellar astrocytoma.    A  simple  arachnoid  cyst  is extra- axial and will not demonstrate an enhancing  nodule,  although  such  a  nodule  may  be  seen  in  a cerebellar  astrocytoma.  Since 40% of cerebellar hemangioblastomas may be solid, this lesion should be included in the differential of a solid or partially solid mass  in  the  posterior  fossa  in  the adult.  These lesions   are   uncommon   in   children, and medulloblastoma, ependymoma, or astrocytoma are more likely than a cerebellar hemangioblastoma when a posterior fossa mass is seen in a child.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The  CPA  is  the  extra-axial  space triangulated by the pons, cerebellum, and petrous temporal  bone.    Located  within  it  are meningeal layers, cranial nerves 5, 7, and 8, CSF and the flocculus of the cerebellum.  \n\nMeningiomas  arise  from the arachnoid granulation cells within the meningeal layers.  Other lesions in the  CPA,  from  which  they must  be  differentiated, include acoustic schwannoma, epidermoid, trigeminal schwannoma, exophytic brain stem glioma, metastasis, cholesteatoma (acquired), cholesterol granuloma, arachnoid  cyst,  aneurysm, and vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia.\n\nAcoustic  schwannomas are  the most common CPA masses and usually arise from the vestibular division of the 8th cranial nerve  within the  internal  auditory  canal.   They present as a mass within the internal auditory canal and often widen the canal.  Meningiomas, on the other hand, are extrinsic to the internal  auditory  canal  although  they  may compress the 7th-8th nerve complex (see Film 2). Classically, meningiomas are hyperdense compared to gray matter  on noncontrast CT and enhance intensely, whereas acoustic neuromas are isodense  or  hypodense  and  also enhance.  It may be difficult to visualize small acoustic neuromas or meningiomas on CT  because  of artifacts from the adjacent petrous temporal bone. When present, changes in the temporal bone can  be  quite  helpful. Acoustic neuroma will widen or erode the internal auditory canal in up  to  90%  of  cases, although small intracanalicular lesions are increasingly recognized with Gd-DTPA MR  prior  to  development  of internal auditory canal abnormalities.  Meningiomas may demonstrate hyperostosis  of  the  adjacent  temporal  bone.  MRI, without bone artifact, surpasses CT for mass localization relative  to  the  internal  auditory canal, especially with the use of Gd-DTPA.  Acoustic schwannomas are isointense to gray matter on T1-weighted images and enhance  homogeneously after Gd-DTPA.  Meningiomas are iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images and  also  enhance  homogeneously,  but are located outside of the internal auditory canal.  On T2-weighted imaging, meningioma has a  variable signal  while  acoustic  schwannoma is usually increased in intensity. \n\nAngiographically, meningiomas classically have a persistent,  homogeneous blush lasting through the venous phase, which is not typical of  schwannoma or  the  other more common CPA lesions.  CPA masses, if large, enough, can be detected angiographically by characteristic displacement of the adjacent vascular  structures.    Such masses  may  elevate and posteriorly displace the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, elevate the superior cerebellar artery, displace the basilar artery if the mass extends  medially,  or  elevate  and compress the petrosal vein.  \n\nThe  other  lesions  within the differential diagnosis are less common.  Epidermoid tumors result from  epidermal  tissue  that  is included within the neural tube during embryonic development.  They may be markedly hypointense to cortex on T1-weighted MRI images (there are  some  reports  of hyperintense epidermoids on T1 imaging) and are hyperintense compared to CSF on T2 imaging with no  enhancement following  Gd - DTPA.   CT demonstrates a hypodense (density slightly greater than CSF) mass without  enhancement;  thus,  differentiation from  meningioma  is  not  difficult.  Trigeminal neuroma is radiographically  similar  to acoustic neuroma except the course follows that of the 5th cranial nerve and the IAC and 7th/8th  nerve  complex  are  normal.  Exophytic brain stem glioma will have both intra- and extra-axial components by multiplanar  MR  imaging.    Arachnoid cysts  have  imaging  characteristics  paralleling  CSF.   Vascular abnormalities can usually be detected  by  MRI  demonstrating  flow void  and/or  clot.   The flocculus of the cerebellum should not be mistaken for a lesion based on  its  known  anatomic  location  and signal  characteristics.    Metastatic  disease may be difficult to distinguish from benign lesions because of the  varied  appearance, unless  one sees multiple lesions or there is obvious bone destruction, which may require CT demonstration.  Acquired  cholesteatomas may  also require CT evaluation of the temporal bone to demonstrate the characteristic pattern of involvement of the middle  ear  which is   necessary   to  differentiate  these  lesions  from  the  bony destruction caused by metastatic disease.",

They account for only 5% of all pulmonary tumors.  The most aggressive form of pulmonary neuroectoderm carcinomas is the small cell lung cancer.  Then, in order of decreasing aggressiveness are atypical bronchial carcinoid tumors and typical carcinoid tumors.  Atypical type occurs in just 10-15% of bronchial carcinoid tumors with typical bronchial carcinoid tumors occurring 85-90% of the time.  Bronchial carcinoid tumors, in general, are slow growing and have a relatively good prognosis after surgical resection, even with metastatic spread to hilar and ipsilateral lymph nodes.  These highly vascular tumors can secrete ACTH and cause Cushing\u2019s syndrome.  \nSymptoms occur from mechanical obstruction of the bronchus by the tumor and present as a cough or wheezing.  Carcinoid syndrome can occur with rare hepatic metastatic disease.  \nThese tumors are visible 25% of the time, if the lesion is central.  CT imaging will typically reveal a well-circumscribed central lesion with soft-tissue attenuation.  It can be difficult to distinguish this from lung carcinoma.  However, the presence of calcification within the tumor, which occurs often, will favor carcinoid over carcinoma.  Octreotide is 96% sensitive for detection of bronchial carcinoid tumors.  PET/CT will not accurately detect carcinoid tumors due to their low metabolic activity.",

Most malignant transformation is to chondrosarcoma although unusual cases of osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma have been reported.  Besides bursal inflammation, pathologic fracture, and malignant transformation, osteochondromas may cause vascular and neurological complications and osseous deformities because of displacement or compression of adjacent structures.

            "Discussion": "Osteomyelitis, an infectious process that produces bony destruction, can be limited to a single area of bone or can involve multiple areas, including the marrow, cortex, periosteum, and surrounding soft tissue.  Osteomyelitis may spread by a hematogenous route, from a contiguous contaminated source (e.g. following trauma, bone surgery, or joint replacement), or be a complication of vascular insufficiency (predominantly in diabetic patients).  Staphylococcus aureus is by far the common pathogen causing osteomyelitis.  The infection may be acute or chronic; acute infections tend to evolve over several days to weeks. Acute infection may resolve with appropriate treatment. Osteomyelitis that is untreated or insufficiently treated may give rise to a chronic infection which may be characterized by a sequestrum (necrotic bone, bacteria, and granulation that have been walled off by new reactive bone or fibrous tissue).  Chronic osteomyelitis is also characterized by the persistence of microorganisms, low-grade inflammation, and fistulous tracts.  Recurrent osteomyelitis in the same area along with the presence of fever is indicative of a chronic infection.  The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and when possible, identification of the offending organism by blood culture or direct bone biopsy.\n\nPlain radiographs should be the first imaging modality for evaluating osteomyelitis. Initially they may be normal or only show periosteal reaction and soft tissue swelling.  Bone destruction (osteolytic foci on the radiographs) may not be visible until 10-21 days after the infection has begun.  With chronicity, reactive osteosclerosis as well as areas of osteolysis and sequestra and involucra may occur. Differentiation of acute osteomyelitis from inactive chronic osteomyelitis can be difficult, but certain indications on the radiograph aid in distinguishing between the two, including a change from a previous radiograph, poorly defined areas of osteolysis,  and thin and linear periostitis.  Although CT is useful for evaluating cortical destruction, sequestration, cloacae, and bone and soft tissue abscesses,  MR imaging (T1-weighted, T2-weighted with fat sat and post contrast sequences) is the best modality for evaluating osteomyelitis, cellulitis and areas of necrosis for debridement. Tc 99m \u2013bone scintigraphy may also be useful for diagnosing osteomyelitis but does not have the resolution of MRI.  Dual isotope bone-granulocyte scintigraphy (Tc 99m MDPbone and white blood cells labeled with Indium-111) has a high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (71%) in detecting areas of acute infection. However, MRI has increased sensitivity and accuracy in the detection of osteomyelitis as compared to three-phase bone scintigraphy.  In cases of acute osteomyelitis, the process is identified as area(s) of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity images in the medullary canal on fat-saturated T2-weighted  MR images or STIR (short tau inversion recovery) MR images. Cellulitis shows similar findings (low-signal-intensity  foci on T1-weighted images and high-signal-intensity foci on fat-saturated T2-weighted or STIR MR images). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted  MR imaging shows not only the enhancement of areas of osteomyelitis and cellulitis, but also shows non-enhancing areas of necrosis important for debridement.  Active and inactive phases of osteomyelitis may be differentiated by  in the acute phase the presence of periosteal bone formation with subperiosteal fluid and areas of high signal intensity areas on T2-weighted and STIR MR images that enhance after contrast media.  Bone sclerosis is low signal intensity on MR sequences. Abscesses and tracts can also be demonstrated on MRI.  For definitive histologic diagnosis, fluoroscopy and/or CT is used to biopsy appendicular and axial lesions and fluoroscopy can be sometimes use for biopsying appendicular lesions.

            "Disease Discussion": "Osteomyelitis, an infectious process that produces bony destruction, can be limited to a single area of bone or can involve multiple areas, including the marrow, cortex, periosteum, and surrounding soft tissue.  Osteomyelitis may spread by a hematogenous route, from a contiguous contaminated source (e.g. following trauma, bone surgery, or joint replacement), or be a complication of vascular insufficiency (predominantly in diabetic patients).  Staphylococcus aureus is by far the common pathogen causing osteomyelitis.  The infection may be acute or chronic; acute infections tend to evolve over several days to weeks. Acute infection may resolve with appropriate treatment. Osteomyelitis that is untreated or insufficiently treated may give rise to a chronic infection which may be characterized by a sequestrum (necrotic bone, bacteria, and granulation tissue that have been walled off by new reactive bone or fibrous tissue).  Chronic osteomyelitis is also characterized by the persistence of microorganisms, low-grade inflammation, and fistulous tracts.  Recurrent osteomyelitis in the same area along with the presence of fever is indicative of a chronic infection.  The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and when possible, identification of the offending organism by blood culture or direct bone biopsy.\n\nPlain radiographs should be the first imaging modality for evaluating osteomyelitis. Initially they may be normal or only show periosteal reaction and soft tissue swelling.  Bone destruction (osteolytic foci on the radiographs) may not be visible until 10-21 days after the infection has begun.  With chronicity, reactive osteosclerosis as well as areas of osteolysis and sequestra and involucra may occur. Differentiation of acute osteomyelitis from inactive chronic osteomyelitis can be difficult, but certain indications on the radiograph aid in distinguishing between the two, including a change from a previous radiograph, poorly defined areas of osteolysis,  and thin and linear periostitis.  Although CT is useful for evaluating cortical destruction, sequestration, cloacae, and bone and soft tissue abscesses,  MR imaging (T1-weighted, T2-weighted with fat sat and post contrast sequences) is the best modality for evaluating osteomyelitis, cellulitis and areas of necrosis for debridement. Tc 99m \u2013bone scintigraphy may also be useful for diagnosing osteomyelitis but does not have the resolution of MRI.  Dual isotope bone-granulocyte scintigraphy (Tc 99m MDP)bone and white blood cells labeled with Indium-111) has a high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (71%) in detecting areas of acute infection.

Cutaneous lesions are present in about one fourth of patients. Although any organ can be affected, 90% of patients demonstrate thoracic involvement with decreased diffusion capacity being the most common abnormality found on pulmonary function testing.  There is a strong association between subcutaneous sarciodosis and bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy (72.7%). Sarciodosis is a diagnosis of exclusion supported by three elements: 1. Compatible clinical and radiologic findings, 2. Tissue biopsy specimen that reveals noncaseating epithelioid granulomas, and 3. Absence of known granulomagenic agents. \n\nEtiology\nA large multi centered study called A Case Control Etiologic Study of Sarciodosis (ACCESS) showed that environmental factors such as mold, mildew, must odors and pesticides were associated with a modestly increased risk (OR~1.5) of developing sarciodosis. Genetics and host factors also are involved in the pathogenesis of sarciodosis.  In the US, blacks are more frequently affected and the ACCESS trial showed that affected patients were five times more likely than controls to report a sibling with the disease.  Further, recent studies have identified specific genes associated with sarciodosis.  A single-nucleotide polymorphism on the BTNL2 gene may influence T-lymphocyte activation and regulation and make people carrying this polymorphism more susceptible to sarciodosis.  A second gene associated with sarciodosis is Annexin A11 on chromosome 10q22.3 responsible for calcium signaling, cell division and apoptosis.  \n\n\n\nDeficits of this gene have been associated with sarciodosis.  Further, HLA haplotypes and T-cell receptor expression play an intricate role in the development of the disease.\n\nBiomarker screening\nIn an attempt to aid in diagnosis of sarciodosis, investigators continue to search for potential biomarkers in disease activity. Chitotriosidase is an enzyme expressed by activated macrophages and Bargagli et al. found elevated levels of this enzyme in patients with sarciodosis, with >90% exhibiting elevated levels of the marker.  A second marker IL-2, a cytokine that induces T-cell proliferation and activation is elevated in serum of patients with sarciodosis and may have prognostic value.  \n\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis of sarciodosis is best supported by a combination of radiographic evidence of lymphadenopathy and tissue specimens that show noncaseating granulomas.  Endobronchial ultrasound guided transbronchial needle aspiration when compared to non-guided transbronchial needle aspiration had a diagnosis yield of 83.3% compared to 53.8%.  \n\nTreatment\nTherapy for patients with chronic sarciodosis requires prolonged treatment often with steroids which cause systemic side effects.  TNF inhibitors have been investigated for the treatment, but a study by Utz et al, found treatment failure in nearly 65% of participants.  A new TNF-alpha antagonist Ustekinumab, approved for dosing in patients with RA, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis; is currently being tested for its efficacy in treatment of sarciodosis with completion of the study anticipated in July 2011.  Surgical indication for patients with sarciodosis remains controversial.  Surgery has potential to reduce symptoms and decrease need for oral steroids, but does not eradicate or prevent recurrence of disease.  Corticosteroids remain the cornerstone for treatment, but care must be taken to assess for potential adverse effects."

            "Disease Discussion": "Primary gastrointestinal lymphoma represents nearly 20% of all malignant soft bowel wall tumors in otherwise previously healthy patients.  Secondary involvement of the bowel by lymphoma is present in more that 50% of all cases.   Most cases are of the non-Hodgkin\u2019s variety.  The usual age at presentation is in 5th and 6th decades of life.  Symptoms can vary depending on the degree of mass effect on the small bowel.  Fatigue, weight loss and emesis is a common presentation. \n\nRadiographic imaging is not entirely specific.  Real time evaluation of the small bowel with digital fluoroscopic exams using barium may show thickened and adherent bowel loops with loss of normal barium transit or frank obstruction.  CT imaging often shows diffuse mesenteric adenopathy, and multiple round enhancing homogenous masses.  The tumor often encases the bowel and causes both aneurismal dilatation and eventual stenosis as the tumor enlarges becomes more lobulated and necrotic.  PET imaging is helpful initially in determining disease extension and perhaps later for chemotherapy and radiation treatment response.  Definitive diagnosis is by percutaneous biopsy.\n\nThe prognosis of the patient depends on the degree of involvement and co-morbid factors.  Younger patients with HIV tend to have high grade and diffuse aggressive disease at presentation and fair much worse than healthy individuals who often present with low-grade malignancy.  Treatment is chemotherapy and radiation.  10 year survival and relapse-free survival for patients with low-grade disease are estimated at 80% and 60%.  10 year survival and relapse-free survival for patients with mid to high-graded disease is estimated at 50% and 50%.",

The most common presenting symptom is recurrent epistaxis due to telangiectasias in the nasal mucosa.\n \nA pulmonary AVM is an abnormal communication between pulmonary arteries and veins without normal intervening capillaries.  About 70% of patients with pulmonary AVM's also have HHT.   Up to 50% of patients with HHT have at least one PAVM.   Multiple PAVM's are common in patients with HHT.\n \nPAVM's can cause symptoms from the right-to-left shunts causing deoxygenation, hemoptysis, hemothorax, and paradoxical embolization.  Patients frequently compensate for the chronic blood deoxygenation.\n\nThe most catastrophic complications are caused by paradoxical embolization to the brain causing stroke, brain abscess, TIAs and pulmonary hemorrhage.\n\nHigh resolution CT is a sensitive screening method for detecting pulmonary AVMs.  Pulmonary angiography remains the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of pulmonary AVM's and is necessary for endovascular treatment with embolization.\n\nIt is recommended that PAVM's with a feeding artery 3 mm or larger should be treated, due to the risk of stroke in these patients.  The most common method of treatment is endovascular deployment of metallic coils into the feeding artery or arteries of the AVM.

Clinically most patients present with cough (usually chronic), recurrent infections and hemoptysis.  Although not a single disease process, bronchiectasis remains a descriptive final common pathway for several distinct disease processes.  Etiologies include:\nPost-infectious: Measles, whooping cough, TB and allergic\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis)\nInflammatory: Association with Crohn\u2019s & Ulcerative Colitis\nCongenital: Bronchial atresia, Williams-Campbell syndrome, Cystic Fibrosis\nObstruction: Primary neoplasm, Foreign body, Enlarged lymph nodes\nImpaired Clearance: Kartagener\u2019s syndrome (Dysmotile cilia syndrome + situs)\nImmunodeficiencies: Hypogammaglobulinemia, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\nPulmonary Fibrosis: Traction bronchiectasis \n\nAlthough findings consistent with bronchiectasis can be observed on routine chest radiographs and moreso on chest CT, dedicated high-resolution CT (HRCT) remains the modality of choice for the evaluation of bronchiectasis.  Although some authors report up to 7% normal chest radiographs in patients with bronchiectasis, even conventional CT may not delineate the etiology in a small percentage of patients.  Therefore, not only does HRCT delineate the location of the lesions in the lung, but remains the most sensitive and specific examination available. \n\nFindings on HRCT include:\n-Lack of bronchial tapering              -wall thickening \n- bronchial dilatation                   -mucoid filling \n-\u201csignet ring\u201d sign  with adjacent pulm artery as stone and bronchi as ring ie: relative enlargement of the bronchial \n-\u201ctram lines\u201d sign \n\nThree classifications have been adopted as standard which include: \n1. Cylindrical: bronchi have fusiform dilation and lack of tapering and presence of abrupt termination.-ABPA\n2. Varicose: usually has a more dilated bronchi than cylindrical, however will have bronchial constrictions that produce an irregular outline to the bronchi. \u2013 Cystic Fibrosis\n3. Cystic: thick-walled saccular dilatations that can have air-fluid levels secondary to retained secretions-Bronchial stenosis\n\nAlthough various disease processes have some regularity, there is some overlap and variablity of the type and location of the involved bronchi.  \n\n\nTreatment:\n\tAntibiotics and respiratory therapy are the mainstays of conservative therapy.  Surgical resection is an option of last resort for advanced disease.  Episodes of massive hemoptysis have been known to occur requiring emergent embolization of involved bronchial artery.  In the case of bronchiectasis in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease however the mainstay of therapy remains steroids as they lesions can undergo striking resolution once proper therapy is initiated.",

The usual age of presentation is 20-40 years of age after the growth plate has been obliterated. Patients usually present with tenderness and swelling over the primary site and rarely pathologic fracture. GCTs comprise 5-9% of all primary bone tumors, 25% of benign bone tumors and are the 6th most common primary bone neoplasm. The majority of GCTs are benign with approximately 5-10% malignant, which are indistinguishable radiographically.  60% occur in the long bones and almost all GCTs involve the articular end of the bone with the following most common sites: proximal tibia, distal femur, distal radius and proximal humerus.   \n\nInitial evaluation is usually with radiography, which  often reveals a geographic, well-defined lucent lesion usually lacking sclerotic margins or periosteal reaction.  The lesion is usually in an eccentric location and usually extends to the articular surface.  Further evaluation requires CT or MRI, which can demonstrate associated soft tissue mass and full extent of the lesion.  MRI is useful in defining the full extent of the tumor in preparation for surgical resection and may occasionally reveal fluid/fluid levels or subchondral breakthrough or joint involvement. \n\nTreatment consists of surgical curettage with bone grafting or orthopedic cement or wide resection with secondary implantation of an allograft endoprosthesis.  Pathologic evaluation reveals vascular tissue with mononuclear stromal cells and multinucleated giant cells of osteoclast type.  Recurrence is frequent (approximately 50%) and usually due to inadequate surgical resection. Recurrence is often manifested radiographically by resorption of the bone graft and appearance of new lucenies.  Malignant degeneration may occur especially following radiation therapy. Even histologically benign tumors may metastasize to lung.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Internal hernia is an uncommon cause of small bowel obstruction that may be increasing in frequency. Because the clinical diagnosis of internal hernia is difficult, imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) and small bowel follow through play an important role. Transmesenteric hernia is the most common type and is usually related to prior abdominal surgery, especially with creation of a Roux-en-Y anastomosis (eg, liver transplantation, gastric bypass). CT may allow confident diagnosis in most cases.\n\nWhen the small bowel herniates through a defect in the mesentery or omentum, the herniated bowel is compressed against the abdominal wall, with no overlying omental fat in most cases and at most levels of anatomic section through the herniated bowel. The herniated bowel tends to appear clustered and lies outside the colon, a reversal of the normal anatomic arrangement. As a result, the adjacent colon is displaced centrally (eg, transverse colon displaced dorsally, ascending colon displaced medially). There will be some degree of compression, crowding, displacement, and obstruction of both the bowel and blood vessels.\n\nThe herniated bowel may also twist within the hernia sac, which results in volvulus and a predisposition to bowel ischemia. Twisting of the mesenteric vessels, or the whirl sign, or twisting of the bowel itself is diagnostic of volvulus, and engorged blood vessels, mesenteric ascites, and bowel wall thickening suggest bowel ischemia.\n\nCT signs most suggestive of transmesenteric hernia are those that depict the abnormal cluster of bowel loops along the periphery of the peritoneal cavity and lack of omental fat covering the clustered small bowel.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Patients with hydrocephalus have a disturbance in the formation, flow, or absorption of their cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), leading to an increased volume occupied by this fluid within the central nervous system.  CSF is made primarily by the choroid plexus within the ventricular system, and is normally produced at a rate of 0.2-0.35 mL/min.  The capacity of the lateral and third ventricles in a healthy adult is approximately 20 mL, with a total CSF volume of approximately 120 mL.  CSF is absorbed through arachnoid granulations back into the systemic venous system.  An imbalance between CSF production and resorption results in an increase in intracranial pressure.\n     The majority of hydrocephalus results from obstructive causes--either intraventricular or extraventricular.  Treatment options for these patients include a variety of surgical options: choroid plexectomy, opening of a stenotic auqaduct, tumor removal (in cases where tumor mass is causing obstruction), fenestration of the floor of the third ventricle, and shunting.  Of these, shunting represents the most common and successful procedure.  Essentially shunts provide a conduit for CSF to drain from the ventricles or subarachnoid space to another compartment of the body.  A variety of options exist, but the preffered route is the ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  Shunts require routine follow up, and in children, revisions on a scheduled basis according to growth rates.  Potential complications include: infection, obstruction, and hardware disconnection, and warrant swift clinical attention with imaging studies to assess the patients intracranial status as well as the shunt hardware.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Silent sinus syndrome is characterized by painless enophthalmos associated with chronic maxillary sinus atelectasis from chronic infundibular obstruction. This results in negative sinus pressure and collapse over time.  This syndrome has primarily been described in the otolaryngology and ophthalmology literature. The patient is typically an adult who presents to an ophthalmologist or an ENT specialist with a chronic history of painless facial asymmetry (one eye lower and sunken), diplopia, or both.  The patient may have symptoms of sinusitis but may be asymptomatic. \n\nThe diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed radiologically. Physical exam reveals a combination of enophthalmos, hypoglobus, upper-lid retraction, deepened upper-lid sulcus, and malar depression.\n\nRadiologic evaluation is primarily by CT.  The imaging findings of the silent sinus syndrome a fully developed and opacified maxillary sinus with occluded infundibulum.  Occlusion is usually caused by lateral retraction of the uncinate process with apposition of the uncinate process against the inferomedial aspect of the orbital wall. There is resultant enlargement of the adjacent middle meatus with associated lateral retraction of the middle turbinate. The feature most characteristic is inward retraction of the sinus walls (medial wall, posterolateral wall, and orbital floor) with associated decrease in sinus volume. The downward retraction of the orbital floor into the maxillary sinus creates the eye or facial asymmetry.\n\nTreatment is surgical involving making an outlet for mucous drainage from the obstructed sinus. A nasal antral window or a maxillary antrostomy is performed endoscopically. The post surgical sinus deformity may remain unchanged, improve slightly, or be restored to a near-normal configuration over time. Additional corrective surgery of the orbital floor may be accomplished.\n\n============================\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=94203633\nhttp://www.ajronline.org/cgi/content/figsonly/178/2/503\nhttp://www.laryngoscope.com/pt/re/laryngoscope/abstract.00005537-200106000-00008.htm;jsessionid=CFN5meDK83rOWfejtjGhVdI9eNOhOeY6WnvGHqPCy2fdePgnNvQU!583875742!-949856031!9001!-1\nhttp://www.laryngoscope.com/pt/re/laryngoscope/abstract.00020840-199902000-00009.htm;jsessionid=CFN58WbqxkzTMJuHWoh1quFdWgPKXuCwImn5HUmV2wdjisErBWqc!583875742!-949856031!9001!-1",

            "Disease Discussion": "Although numerous studies utilizing new imaging modalities such as helical CT scans have been performed to improve the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism (PE), ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scans remain the screening tool of choice.  This test is a nuclear medicine study that compares images of inhaled radionuclide material to pulmonary perfusion images of intravenously injected radiolabeled protein.  These images must be closely compared to a chest X-ray taken at or near the time of the V/Q scan.  This is done to ensure defects on the V/Q images are not accounted for by findings on the chest X-ray.  A high probability scan, defined as two or more moderate or large segmental mismatched perfusion defects, in the presence of high clinical suspicion was found to be accurate 96% of the time in the PIOPED study.  The same study also found that a low probability scan in the presence of low clinical suspicion was only falsely negative in 6% of the patients.  However, this leaves a large number of cases in which there is either a moderate clinical suspicion, an intermediate scan, or a discrepancy between pre-test clinical suspicion and final test results.  Therefore, more invasive tests such as pulmonary angiography must often be used for a definitive diagnosis.  \n\nThe chest X-ray is also an important tool in the evaluation a patient with a suspected PE.  In addition to being used in the interpretation of the V/Q scan as mentioned above, chest x-rays are often useful in determining that the cause of the patient's signs and symptoms is due to a condition other than PE.  For example, a fractured rib or cavitary lung lesion may present in a manner similar to PE.  In relatively uncommon situations, radiologic findings on chest X-ray such as decreased vascular markings distal to engorged arteries (Westermark's sign) or a wedge-shaped pleural based infiltrate (Hampton's hump) may lead to the diagnosis of PE.",

            "Title": "Hiatal Hernia",
            "Disease Discussion": "In the United States and Canada, a large proportion of adults undergoing upper gastrointestinal barium radiographs are found to have a small hiatal hernia. About 90% to 95% of hiatal hernias found by radiograph are sliding hernias, and the rest are paraesophageal or mixed.  Most sliding hiatal hernias are small and of little clinical significance. Patients with symptomatic paraesophageal hernias are most often middle-aged to elderly.  Many patients with small, simple sliding hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. The main clinical significance of the sliding hiatal hernia is its contribution to gastroesophageal reflux . In addition to heartburn and regurgitation, patients with large sliding hiatal hernias may complain of dysphagia or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen. In a prospective, population-based study the risk of iron-deficiency anemia was found to be increased  in adults with hiatal hernia. On chest radiograph a hiatal hernia may be noted as a soft tissue density in the retrocardiac area. Hiatal hernias are most often diagnosed on upper gastrointestinal barium radiographic studies. At endoscopy the gastroesophageal junction is noted to be proximal to the impression of the diaphragm. [1]\n\nPatients with paraesophageal and mixed hiatal hernias are rarely completely asymptomatic if closely questioned. About half of patients with paraesophageal hernias have gastroesophageal reflux. Other symptoms include dysphagia, chest pain, vague postprandial discomfort, and shortness of breath. A substantial number of patients have chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. If the hernia is complicated by gastric volvulus, acute abdominal pain and retching will occur, often progressing rapidly to a surgical emergency. A paraesophageal or mixed hiatal hernia may be seen on chest radiograph as an abnormal soft tissue density (often with a gas bubble) in the mediastinum. Upper gastrointestinal radiograph is the best diagnostic study. [1]\n\nHiatal hernias are occasionally complicated by volvulus. The stomach is normally fixed in position by ligamentous attachments to the duodenum, spleen, liver, and diaphragm. Laxity of these ligaments, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, adhesions, gastric tumor, or masses in adjacent organs may predispose to volvulus. In about one third of cases the volvulus occurs below the diaphragm. In the other two thirds of cases volvulus occurs above the diaphragm in association with a diaphragmatic hernia. Sliding hiatal hernias are not associated with gastric volvulus.  Gastric volvulus may be mesenteroaxial or organoaxial. In about 60% of cases gastric volvulus is organoaxial: the stomach twists along its long axis. This axis usually passes through the gastroesophageal and gastropyloric junctions. The antrum rotates anteriorly and superiorly, the fundus posteriorly and inferiorly, twisting the greater curvature at some point along its length. This type of volvulus is commonly associated with a diaphragmatic hernia. Organoaxial volvulus is usually an acute event. Vascular compromise and gastric infarction may occur. The other major type of gastric volvulus is mesenteroaxial, in which the stomach folds on its short axis running across from the lesser curvature to the greater curvature, and the antrum twists anteriorly and superiorly. [1]\n\nSimple sliding hiatal hernias do not require treatment. Patients with symptomatic giant sliding hiatal hernias, paraesophageal, and mixed hernias should be offered surgery. Many experts suggest that surgery should be offered to patients with asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias, because about 30% of these patients will develop complications if left untreated. Many surgeons routinely perform a fundoplication on all repairs, both to prevent postoperative reflux esophagitis and to fix the stomach in the abdomen. Less commonly a gastrostomy is used to fix the stomach in position. Patients with sliding hiatal or paraesophageal hernias may have shortening of the esophagus. This makes it difficult to restore the gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragm without tension. In such cases an extra length of neoesophagus can be constructed from the proximal stomach (Colles-Nissen procedure). Paraesophageal and mixed hernias can be repaired through the chest or abdomen, with open or laparoscopic techniques. Compared with open repair, laparoscopic repair is associated with less blood loss, fewer overall complications, shorter hospital stay, and quicker return to normal activities. Long-term results are probably equal with either approach. Potential surgical complications include esophageal and gastric perforation, pneumothorax, and liver laceration. Potential long-term complications may include dysphagia if the wrap is too tight or gastroesophageal reflux if the fundoplication breaks down or migrates into the chest. Recurrence rates are about 10 [1]\n \n\n1.

            "Disease Discussion": "Appendicitis occurs most frequently in the 2nd to 3rd decade of life, less commonly in the extremes of age.  Pain is usually the initial presenting complaint and often starts in the peri-umbilical region before migrating to the right lower quadrant with maximal tenders often located at McBurney\u2019s point.  This typical sequence is absent in more than 1/3 of older children.  Often pain is worse with movement, coughing (cough sign) driving over bump (cat\\'s eye sign), or standing on toes and dropping heels to ground (heel drop sign) (Rothrock).  Vomiting occurs in the majority of school-aged children and may precede or begin concurrent with pain.  Physical exam often reveals an elevated temperature and tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant.  However, tenderness may involve the entire lower abdomen, or may be diffuse, especially with a perforation.  Compared with those with non-perforated appendicitis, children with perforated appendicitis are significantly younger, have a longer duration of symptoms before diagnosis, have more physician visits before correct diagnosis, have higher temperatures, and are more likely to exhibit vomiting, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and peritoneal signs (Rothrock).  Perforation generally occurs 36 to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.     Plain abdominal radiographs have been recommended as potentially useful for evaluating children with suspected appendicitis.  Radiographic findings believed to be suggestive of appendicitis include rightward scoliosis, soft tissue masses, localized ileus, bowel obstruction, calcified fecolith, and free peritoneal fluid.  Of these features, the most specific for appendicitis is a calcified fecolith (appendicolith) found in up to 13% to 22% with appendicitis and in only 1% to 2% of those without (Rothrock).  While often recommended, these films rarely altered a patient\\'s diagnosis or management.       Ultrasonography is appropriate in patients in which the diagnosis is unclear by history and physical examination, especially in pediatric and female patients.  A normal appendix must be identified to rule out appendicitis.  An inflamed appendix usually measures greater than 6 mm in diameter, is non-compressible and tender with focal compression (Hardin).  Numerous other right lower quadrant conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cecal diverticulitis, Meckel\\'s diverticulum, endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease can cause false-positive ultrasonography results (Hardin).       Appendiceal CT is more accurate than ultrasound and consists of a focused, helical CT after a Gastrografin-saline enema.  It can be performed and interpreted usually within an hour.  The accuracy of CT is due in part to its ability to identify a normal appendix better than ultrasound.  If appendiceal CT is not available, standard abdominal/pelvic CT with contrast remains useful and may still be more accurate than ultrasound (Hardin).     The standard for management of appendicitis remains appendectomy.  The procedure may be performed by laparotomy (usually through a small right lower quadrant incision) or laparoscopy.  While laparoscopic intervention is advantageous in adults due to decreased postoperative pain, earlier return to normal activity and better cosmetic results, an open appendectomy remains the primary approach to treatment in children due to their smaller size (Rothrock).\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15155894",

            "Disease Discussion": "Arteriovenous fistulas (AVFs) are abnormal connections between arteries and veins that bypass the normal anatomic capillary beds.  AVFs of the lower extremity can be divided into congenital and acquired causes.  Iatrogenic causes, primarily occurring during cardiac catheterization, are the most common etiology.  These may ensue when a needle tract crosses both femoral the artery and vein, and is then dilated during catheterization, creating a communication between the vessels after catheter removal.  In three large series from experienced cardiac catheterization centers, the incidence of AVF was 0.1-0.2%. Similar values have been noted with the use of arterial closure devices. Other femoral arterial complications include pseudoaneurysm formation, hematoma, groin hemorrhage that may require transfusion, and arterial occlusion.  Risk factors for AVF formation during catheterization include low femoral arterial puncture, large arterial sheath size, older age, and prolonged anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy. The incidence is higher in therapeutic compared to diagnostic catheterization (0.9 versus 0.2% in one report).\n\nAlmost all AVFs are clinically silent early in the postcatheterization period. If untreated, the time of onset of clinical presentation ranges from two days to several months after catheterization.  Clinical complications include lower extremity edema, varicose veins, nerve compression, the development of or worsening of intermittent claudication, and rest pain secondary to distal ischemia. The most significant complication is the development of high-output heart failure which, in an older report, was estimated to occur after 0.01 to 0.02 percent of cardiac catheterizations.\n\nEarly diagnosis is dependent upon careful examination of the groin area, with evaluation for a femoral bruit, large hematoma, decreased or absent lower extremity pulses, or a groin pulsatile mass. Any of these findings is suggestive of a vascular complication and needs to be investigated further.  Prior to the development and widespread use of ultrasound-Doppler technology, AVFs were suspected on clinical findings and diagnosed with an arteriogram. However, Doppler ultrasound is the current diagnostic test of choice in evaluating patients with suspected AVFs. The ultrasound image appears as a blush in the extremity and the connecting artery and vein can often be identified.\n\nBecause of greater awareness and ease of diagnosis, AVFs come to attention and, if necessary, are treated early. On the other hand, small AVFs are often monitored with ultrasound imaging. Indications for intervention are lack of spontaneous closure, increase in fistula size, and/or the development of symptoms.  Surgical repair is the most common approach for fistulas that need closure, but other modalities have been evaluated. These nonsurgical alternatives may be particularly important in patients treated with aggressive antiplatelet therapy. One method is ultrasound-guided compression repair or closure (UGCR). This technique involves placing the ultrasound probe on the skin over the AVF and then compressing the area (usually for ten minute periods) with a sufficient force to abolish flow through the fistula without sacrificing distal perfusion of the leg. Compression results in stasis of blood in the fistula and secondary thrombosis.  UGCR has been used successfully in pseudoaneurysms after cardiac catheterization, but only limited data are available for AVFs with variable success.\n\nPreliminary data suggest that percutaneous approaches also may prove to have a role. One report evaluated 53 patients, 21 with an AV fistula and most of the remainder with a pseudoaneurysm, who failed repeated attempts at UGCR. The patients were primarily treated with either implantation of a covered stent or coil embolization. The procedure was successful in 47 (89 percent). Follow-up documented closure of all lesions, but four late stent occlusions occurred at three to six months.  This study and other early investigations are suggestive that percutaneous interventions such as stent placement or embolization may be effective measures to avoid surgical repair when UGCR fails to result in obliteration of the AVF.",

            "Title": "Hyperflexion Injuries of the Cervical Spine",
            "Disease Discussion": "Hyperflexion injuries are a common mechanism of injury of the cervical spine, accounting for up to 46% of cervical spinal injuries, and include a spectrum of radiographic abnormalities.  The mechanism of the hyperflexion injury is usually a significant force directed against the occiput, forcing the face towards the chest, and resulting primarily in distraction of the posterior structures, with a lesser force vector resulting in compression of the anterior column.  The spectrum of injuries ranges from the relatively stable \u201chyperflexion sprain\u201d to the unstable flexion injuries (flexion teardrop fractures and bilateral locked/jumped facets).  \n\nThe \u201chyperflexion sprain\u201d is a ligamentous injury associated with varying degrees of disruption of the posterior ligaments (progressively involving the supraspinous ligaments, interspinous ligaments, facet joint capsules, and posterior longitudinal ligament, respectively), usually without associated fractures.  These patients present with persistent pain, muscle spasms and, occasionally, mild reversible neurologic defects.  Radiographic abnormalities, when they are present, include widening of the interspinous distance or posterior aspect of the apophyseal joints, and/or localized kyphotic angulation of the cervical spine. \n\nOccasionally, a pure hyperflexion injury of the cervical spine completely spares the posterior ligaments and results only in osseous disruption of the anterior column, manifesting as either avulsion of the anterior portion of the superior vertebral ring (in the immature skeleton) or simple compression fractures of one or more vertebrae (in adults).\n\nAnother stable hyperflexion injury of the C-spine is the clay-shoveler\u2019s fracture, an oblique fracture of one or more of the spinous processes of the sixth cervical through third thoracic vertebrae, from avulsion by the supraspinous ligament.\n\n============== UNSTABLE INJURY ================\nAs previously mentioned, bilateral locked/jumped facets are one example of an unstable hyperflexion injury and result from rupture of the posterior portion of the annulus fibrosus, the posterior longitudinal ligament, and the capsular, interspinous, and supraspinous ligaments.  Destabilization of the ligamentous support-structure of the spine allows such severe anterolisthesis of the cephalad portion of the cervical spinal column that facet locking occurs, with resultant severe narrowing of both the spinal canal and intervertebral neural foramina.  Consequently, this injury pattern is invariably associated with neurologic deficits (75 percent of cases).  The radiographic hallmark of bilateral jumped/locked facets is greater than 50% (half the width of the vertebral body) of anterior displacement of the superior vertebra, as demonstrated on the lateral radiograph.  Associated osseous injuries include avulsion fractures of the spinous process above the locked level, and triangular fractures of the anterosuperior corner of the inferior vertebral body.\n\nA second type of unstable hyperflexion C-spine injury is the flexion teardrop fracture, which typically results from the combination of flexion and axial loading.  This injury manifests radiographically as an anteroinferior (teardrop) fracture fragment of a lower cervical vertebra (most commonly C5).  The teardrop fragment may be large and frequently retains anatomic alignment with the adjacent inferior vertebral body or shows minimal anterior and downward displacement, while the larger posterior fragment shows posterior displacement relative to the vertebra below.  Frequently, concomitant sagittal fractures through the vertebral body and laminae (associated with axial loading) are also present.\n \n=============== ADDITIONAL PEARLS:  \n\nIf the flexion force is associated with a rotational component, either a unilateral perched facet or a unilateral locked facet may result..  This category of C-spine injuries accounts for approximately 12% of the total.\n\nThe other C-spine hyperflexion injuries are: anterior subluxation, vertebral compression, flexion teardrop fracture, and spinous process (clay shoveler\u2019s) fracture.",

            "Discussion": "Hepatocellular adenomas (HA) are usually large, fatty, well circumscribed, nonlobulated, encapsulated tumors.  HA are typically solitary in nature, but ~20% are multiple.  They typically do not have bile ducts or portal vein areas.  They are typically rows of heapatocytes.  HA can develop central necrosis and hemorrhage because the vascular supply is often restricted to the outer surface of the tumor.  Typically in young woman using oral contraceptives pills (OCP) HA is one of the more common hepatic neoplasm as in this patient.  Also, individuals with hemochromatosis , glycogen storage disease, acromegaly, and anabolic steroids users with a hepatic mass are likely to be HA as well.  Some believe that the OCP & anabolic steroids lead to generalized vascular ectasia of the liver leading to the development of HA.  80% of adenomas are solitary and 20% are multiple.\n\nComputed Tomography (CT) in triple phase liver dedicated study demonstrate most HA as a lesion with homogeneous enhancement in the late arterial phase, that will stay isodense to the liver in later phases.  However, these findings in the late arterial phase are not specific to adenomas, since hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), hemangiomas, hypervascular metastases, & focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH) can show similar enhancement in the arterial phase.  The finding of hemorrhage as an area of high attenuation can be seen in as many as 40% of adenomas.  Fat deposition within adenomas is often difficult to identify on CT and is better visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\nDue to the risk of intraperitoneal hemorrhage of the HA & the rare occurrence of malignant transformation to HCC, surgical resection has been advocated as the best solution for patients with presumed HA as was done in this case.  Percutaneous fine needle biopsy of a mass suspicious for HA is controversial because of a significant risk hemorrhage & difficult to distinguish from FNH histologically (FNH does not require surgical resection), however, was still performed in this case, but diagnosis could not be made from biopsy.    Also, HA may also decrease in size if not disappear after OCPs have been stopped, in this pt the lesion was felt to be too large to pursue this treatment.  \n\nReference:\nRichard Baron. \u201cLiver : Masses Part II : common liver tumors\u201d.

These tumors are usually 5-10 cm in size, have a capsule and are made up of benign hepatocytes.  \n\nOn CT, hepatic adenomas usually are well defined and hypoattenuating.

In metastatic disease, there are usually multiple lesions that are T1 hypointense, T2 markedly hyperintense.  Fat and hemorrhage is common in adenomas but rare in metastases.\n\nTreatment of hepatic adenomas is controversial.  It usually involves cesation of oral contraceptives.  Some literature advocates removal of the lesion due to risk of hemorrhage and malignant transformation.",

            "Discussion": "Since the first description of acute appendicitis in 1886 by Reginald Fitz, it has been recognized as one of the most common causes of the acute abdomen worldwide; with 250,000 cases yearly in the United States. Sixty five percent of patients that have symptoms of acute appendicitis for longer than 48 hours present with perforation of the appendix due to significant inflammation and necrosis. Perforation of the appendix can cause widespread intraperitoneal contamination or a sealed-off abscess, and can be lethal if not promptly recognized. The size of the perforation, the virulence of bacterial infection, and the ability of the infection to be contained will determine the extent of the inflammatory response. Abscesses are variable in size, have low attenuation numbers (10 to 30 Hounsfield units) and may display an identifiable capsule which signals chronicity. If the abscess is due to gas-forming bacteria or fistulization to bowel occurs, bubbles of air or air-fluid levels may be observed.  Abscesses may be found in locations distant from the cecum due to variable position of the appendix and the patterns of fluid migration in the peritoneal cavity. Most abscesses are located inferior, medial, or posterior to the cecum or in the right paracolic gutter.  \n\nIt has been suggested that imaging is not necessary if a patient presents with history and physical exam strongly suggestive of acute appendicitis. However, imaging is advisable for the patients with atypical symptoms, infants, small children, and young women\n\nRadiographs demonstrate some abnormality in up to 80% of patients with acute appendicitis. Appendicoliths are the most specific radiographic sign, but are only found in 10% of patients with acute appendicitis. However, when an appendicolith is present, the incidence of perforation is nearly 50%. Appendicoliths can be differentiated from bone islands, ureteral stones and pheleboliths by their calcified rims.  In cases of retrocecal appendicitis, the appendicolith may be located in the right upper quadrant. Other radiographic findings suggestive of acute appendicitis are: cecal ileus, right lower quadrant fluid levels, paucity of right lower quadrant gas, distortion of flank stripe, loss of psoas margin, loss of properitoneal flank stripe, thickening of cecal wall, scoliosis, mottled gas collection in right lower quadrant, and pneumoperitoneum\n\nHigh resolution or helical CT techniques have been shown to be superior to radiographs in establishing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis due to high accuracy and sensitivity. CT scans have accuracy of 96% to 98%, sensitivity of 96% to 100%, specificity 95% to 97%, a PPV of 97% to 99%, and a NPV of 88% to 100%\nThe diagnosis of appendicitis can be made with confidence when an abnormal appendix is identified or when an appendicolith associated with a phlegmon or abscess is detected in the right lower quadrant.  The abnormal appendix appears slightly distended, fluid filled structure about 0.5 to 2cm in diameter.  In almost all cases of acute appendicitis, the appendiceal wall may display circumferential and asymmetrical thickening. Periappendicieal inflammation is another hallmark of acute appendicitis. The inflammatory response is variable and may show the following: Slightly increased hazy density of the mesenteric fat, linear strands, fluid containing abscesses, or heterogeneous ill defined soft tissue densities representing a phelgmon. A summary of findings of acute appendicitis seen on CT scan are listed below:\n\nCircumferential mural thickening of appendix \nMural contrast enhancement\nAppendicolith\nHazy, streaked periappendiceal densities\nPericecal soft tissue mass (phlegmon)\nPericecal fluid collection (abscess)\nMural thickening of adjacent cecum and terminal ileum \u201cArrowhead sign\u201d\nCecal bar\nFocal cecal apical thickening\nEnlarged lymph nodes\nPneumoperitoneum\n\nIn patients without acute appendicitis CT is also useful as it is able to diagnose other intra abdominal conditions. Using CT in patients with equivocal clinical presentations leads to a substantial decrease in the expected negative appendectomy rate. (4% compared to an expected 20% negative laparotomy rate based on clinical evaluation.)"

            "Title": "Mature Cystic Teratoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Teratomas are germ cell tumors that typically present as large, benign (80%) or malignant (20%), mass lesions - usually containing variable amounts of fat, soft tissue, and fluid-filled cystic areas.  Thirty percent contain calcifications.  They vary from an almost entirely cystic mass to a predominately solid mass with internal cystic components.\n\nBenign (mature) cystic teratomas, often incorrectly termed \"dermoid cysts\", are usually found in female patients 10-30 years old - very common in the reproductive years.  Teratoma is the most common ovarian tumor in children, adolescents, and young women (<30 years) with the majority presenting in adolescents.  Fifteen to 25% of cases are bilateral.  Most authors differentiate Dermoid cysts from Dermoids which are predominately cystic, but the presence of heterogeneous and varied tissue elements give them a complex and varied imaging appearance. \n\nTrue dermoids - unlike mature cystic teratomas - originate from ectoderm only and may contain hair, teeth, and sebaceous glands, whereas teratomas originate from multipotential germ cells that may and may contain any tissue element: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm .\n\nTeratomas may also be found in the mediastinum, intracranially, or anywhere rests of multipotential germ cells were left during embryogenesis.  In fact, teratomas are the most common congenital intracranial tumor.  Additionally, teratomas are the most common benign mediastinal germ cell neoplasm and may be cystic or solid.  The cystic teratomas are usually more mature and more common than the solid type which is usually malignant.  \n\nBenign teratomas have a slight female predominance; and, malignant teratomas are seen almost exclusively in men.  Malignant abdominopelvic teratomas may be accompanied by ascites, intraperitoneal spread, and metastasis to the liver.  \n\nMalignant degeneration of a mature cystic teratoma is rare - but may occurs in 1-2% of cases.  \n\nCommon complications of ovarian teratomas include torsion (ovarian) and hemorrhage.\n\nThe initial imaging modality is usually a sonographic study, as many patients present with abdominal pain.  The mixture of sebum and hair within a mature teratoma is highly echogenic with acoustic shadowing that may totally obscure the back wall of a large mass, a finding known as the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d sign.   However, calcification may not be easily detected on ultrasound and plain radiographs may be diagnostic of benign cystic teratomas by demonstrating well formed teeth or bone.  A recognizable tooth within the mass is an almost pathognomonic finding.  Plain film may also reveal a subtle well-defined mass of fat density.  \n\nCT scan confirms the cystic, fatty, and calcified components and demonstrates a well circumscribed cystic mass lesion with fluid, fat, and calcification.  \n\nCharacterization by MRI depends on demonstration of fat by chemical shift artifact or fat suppression imaging.  Fat or sebaceous material within the cyst follows the signal of subcutaneous fat on all imaging sequences.  Fat-fluid levels, layering of debris, dermoid plugs (mural nodules), and calcifications are additional findings.  A small percentage of cystic teratomas contain simple fluid showing low signal on T1WI and high signal on T2WI which may be diagnosed as teratomas by demonstration of small deposits of fat in the walls.",

Spread of infection is mainly hematogenous, however vertebral osteomyelitis can result from non-hematogenous sources such as direct inoculation from spinal surgery and penetrating trauma.  Blood-borne bacteria can seed the vertebral bodies via the spinal arteries. The primary venous route for extension from the pelvis to the spine is Batson\u2019s vertebral venous plexus. This plexus contains no valves and is of variable direction, depending on the intra-abdominal pressure. Vertebral body endplates are well vascularized, and it is within the large venous sinusoids that the multidirectional blood flow allows the infection to spread throughout the vertebral bodies. Once the vertebral body endplates are infected, the pathogen can break through these endplates into the intervertebral space with resultant discitis. Most patients with vertebral osteomyelitis result from a remote site of infection, most frequently the urinary tract by hematogenous seeding.  Less commonly, affected patients have history of skin, respiratory, gastrointestinal or pelvic infections, or an episode of penetrating or non-penetrating trauma prior to the onset of vertebral osteomyelitis.  ent:",

            "Diagnosis By": "Imaging findings",
            "Treatment & Follow Up": "Children with NF1 should be monitored for developmental progress and should be seen yearly for neurological exams. More about general treatment for NF1 patients will be discussed in the discussion.  As for her specific findings on this CT study, treatment and follow-up are as follows:\n\nPlexiform neurofibroma:  Lesions usually involve multiple nerve fascicles with significant vascularity. Thus, surgical excision is generally difficult and frustrating, with excessive bleeding and a poor cosmetic result. Repeated debulking may be necessary for severe symptoms, and orbital evisceration for extensive cases. Radiotherapy offers no benefit. However, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, which inhibit growth of these tumors in animals, are a possible treatment in the future and are currently undergoing clinical trials.  Of concern, there is a small risk of malignant transformation of these tumors. They may occasionally erode into the anterior cranial fossa, which results in death.\n\nOptic nerve glioma:  The radiologist of this case recommended further evaluation with MRI of the brain and orbits. If the MRI is positive for an optic nerve glioma, MRI and an ophthalmic exam are repeated every 3-6 months. Otherwise, if vision is ok, observation is the treatment. If the tumor progresses, the child should be referred to neurooncology for evaluation.  Surgical excision is offered if a tumor approaches the chiasm. Surgery also is indicated for pain or disfiguring proptosis. The role of radiotherapy remains controversial; it may be associated with CNS complications. More recently, chemotherapy has shown promising results.",
            "Discussion": "Our patient has been given the definitive diagnosis of NF1 because of the plexiform neurofibroma and sphenoid hypoplasia.  It is a likely assumption that the optic nerve mass is an optic nerve glioma given this patient\u2019s diagnosis of NF1.  Follow-up MRI should reveal a hypotense to isotense T1 signal and variable intensity compared to muscle on T2 weighted imaging.  Enhancement with gadolinium is also variable. Typically, the lesion appears as a fusiform enlargement of the optic nerve, possibly involving the optic chiasm. The nerve may appear kinked with cystic spaces.\n\nIf no potential problem develops, this 2 year old needs yearly medical visits to include physical exam, ophthalmologic exam, growth measurements, assessment for precocious puberty, developmental assessment, and review of educational progress. Also, as previously mentioned, because of her tumors, she would need a follow-up MRI every 3-6 months.  Obviously, this management involves a multidisciplinary team involving genetics, neurology, ophthalmology, dermatology, neurosurgery, and plastic surgery."

            "Disease Discussion": "NF1 also known as von Recklinghausen\u2019s disease is a common neurocutaneous disorder and the most common type of neurofibromatosis.  It is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1 in 3000.  It involves chromosome 17, which encodes for the protein neurofibromin, which is expressed in many tissues including brain, kidney, spleen, and thymus.  Mutations leading to loss of function of this protein results in a wide spectrum of clinical findings.\n\nDiagnostic criteria were developed in 1987 by the NIH Consensus Conference (updated in 1997) and are based on clinical features. Two of the following must be present to diagnose as NF1:  6 or more caf?-au-lait macules (>5mm-prepuberty or >15mm-postpuberty), 2 or more neurofibromas of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, optic glioma, 2 or more Lisch nodules, distinctive bony lesion (i.e. sphenoid dysplasia, thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudoarthrosis), a first degree relative diagnosed with NF1.\n\nOptic nerve glioma is a pilocytic astrocytoma that primarily affects children. The lesion may be bilateral in NF1 (29% of optic gliomas are associated with NF1).  Clinical findings include gradual loss of vision, optic atrophy or edema, and exophthalmos. Eighty percent of patients experience an initial decrease in vision which then stabilizes. Hypothalamic signs, to include precocious or delayed puberty, may be seen in 22% of cases. Prognosis for vision is poor. Lesions initially confined to the optic nerve have a mortality of 10%. Lesions involving the chiasm have a mortality of 20%. With midbrain and hypothalamus involvement, the prognosis is poor, with mortality greater than 55%.\n\nPlexiform neurofibroma is the most common benign peripheral nerve tumor in the eyelid and orbit. The tumor grows along the nerve, is not encapsulated, and is invasive. Children in the first decade of life are most commonly affected. The tumor tends to grow along sensory nerves, but also may involve motor, parasympathetic, and sympathetic nerves.  Thirty one percent of plexiform neurofibromas occur in the eyelids.  The clinical description of this tumor is as a palpable \u201cbag of worms,\u201d with thickened overlying skin and an S-shaped eyelid.  On MRI the T1 is hypointense and the T2 hyperintense to muscle.",

            "Title": "Midgut malrotation",
            "Disease Discussion": "Embryology:  The alimentary tract initially develops as a pouchlike extension of the yolk sac. At 6 weeks gestation, the intestinal tract is a continuous, tubular structure that is divided into the foregut (supplied by the celiac artery), midgut (supplied by the superior mesenteric artery), and hindgut (supplied mainly by the inferior mesenteric artery). During embryonic development, the bowel introduces itself into the abdomen and both the duodenojejunal and ileocolic segments of the primitive digestive tube rotate 270\u00b0 counterclockwise about the omphalomesenteric vessels (ie, the future superior mesenteric artery and superior mesenteric vein) to reach their final normal positions.  Before 6 weeks gestation, the duodenum initially rotates 90\u00b0 counterclockwise so that it lies to the right of the superior mesenteric artery. Similarly, the cecum rotates 90\u00b0 counterclockwise so that it lies to the left of the superior mesenteric artery. During the 6th week of gestation, the duodenum rotates another 90\u00b0 counterclockwise so that it lies posterior to the superior mesenteric artery. By the 10th to 12th weeks of gestation, the intestine slides back into the peritoneal cavity, where the final 90\u00b0 rotation of the duodenum and 180\u00b0 rotation of the cecum occur. The right colon is the last portion of the gastrointestinal tract to rotate completely, allowing the cecum to descend into the right lower quadrant. This rotation is followed in the last stage by peritoneal fixation of the bowel. The small bowel mesentery is normally broad based, with its attachment extending from the ligament of Trietz to the ileocecal valve. This wide base prevents the small intestine from twisting around the superior mesenteric artery. Malrotation most commonly is caused by incomplete rotation (<270\u00b0 of counterclockwise rotation occurring in weeks 5-12).\n\nThis group of disorders can be divided into 3 different categories:1) Nonrotation (0\u00b0 to <90\u00b0 of counterclockwise rotation occurring before 6 weeks), 2) Reverse rotation (abnormal rotation >90\u00b0 and <180\u00b0 causing obstruction or reversal of the normal duodenal/SMA relationship, occurring in weeks 6-10), and 3) Malrotation most often associated with malfixation (>180\u00b0 and <270\u00b0 of counterclockwise rotation, occurring after 10 weeks). Nonrotation is often an incidental finding in older children and adults during routine examination, but volvulus as a result of local clockwise rotation may accompany this anomaly.\n\nClinical: Incidence is unknown, as many are asymptomatic. No racial or gender predilection is seen. In approximately 60% of patients, malrotation presents by age 1 month with bilious vomiting and high intestinal obstruction. Another 20-30% of patients present at age 1-12 months. Older children with malrotation may show failure to thrive, chronic recurrent abdominal pain, malabsorption, or other vague presentations. The older the child, the less readily identifiable the clinical presentation. Nonrotation of the intestine may be asymptomatic, thus is an incidental finding on UGI performed for other reasons. \n\nRadiographic findings: \nPlain films: In midgut volvulus, the classic radiographic finding is a partial duodenal obstruction (dilation of both the stomach and proximal duodenum, with paucity of bowel gas distally). \nUGI: The preferred diagnostic test for malrotation with midgut volvulus. Duodenal-jejunal junction (DJJ) displaced downward and to the right on the frontal view An abnormal position of the jejunum (lying on right side of abdomen) should alert one to the possibility of a malrotation but should not be relied upon to either make or exclude the diagnosis. Corkscrew of small bowel around SMA.\nUS: The \"whirlpool sign\" on color Doppler shows mesentery and flow within the SMV wrapping around the SMA (in a clockwise direction), indicating malrotation with volvulus \nCT: The DJJ is low and to the right of the normal location. The duodenum doesn\u2019t cross midline. The proximal jejunum is in the right upper quadrant. The cecum is in the upper and/or left abdomen. The large bowel is in the left abdomen. Abnormal relationship of the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) to the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). The SMV should lie to the right of the SMA. \n\nTreatment: Silent malrotation requires no treatment. Symptomatic malrotation in an infant requires surgical correction and midgut volvulus is a surgical emergency.",

This is a condition marked by thickening and fibrosis of the gastric wall with subsequent luminal narrowing, gastric wall rigidity, nondistensibility, and hypoperistalsis.  The most common site of gastric adenocarcinoma occurrence is the antral and pyloric regions (with variable spread proximally toward the gastric body).  The fundus is least often involved.\n\nCT is the imaging study of choice to demonstrate tumor spread, either locally by direct extension or distant metastases to lymph nodes, liver, ovary, adrenals, kidneys, and/or peritoneum.  Other causes of linitis plastica are listed in the differential diagnosis section for this case, but certain etiologies will be briefly mentioned.\n\nNon-hodgkin lymphoma commonly involves the stomach by submucosal spread but rarely results in a true linitis plastica pattern.  Gastric Hodgkin lymphoma is much less common but will more often result in linitis plastica.  Hematogenous metastatic disease, most often from breast cancer, is another cause of linitis plastica.  Rare benign causes of linitis plastica include Crohn?s disease, sarcoidosis, atyplical infection (e.g., syphilis and tuberculosis), eosinophilic gastritis, vasculitis, corrosive agents, gastric irradiation, amyloidosis, iron intoxication, and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.\n\nhttp://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert=36273",

Patients with left ventricular noncompaction often exhibit symptoms of congestive failure.  \n\nIn this case, MDCT findings correlated well with with MR findings and could be used to establish the diagnosis independent of other modalities."

            "Title": "Left Ventricular Non Compaction",
            "Disease Discussion": "Left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) is a congenital cardiomyopathy associated with loose trabeculations in the middle and apical segments of the left ventricle.  It is thought to result from\nfailure of compaction of the myocardium during development. Patients have variable age at presentation from birth to the 4th decade of life, with earlier presentations portending a worse prognosis. There has been no predilection for race or sex elucidated to this point.  Both familial and sporadic cases have been documented, demonstrating isolated LVNC and presentations associated with other\ncardiac anomalies.  The patient in this case has a history which points to a familial form; however, no formal testing exists as research into potential mutations is ongoing.\n\nDiagnostic parameters with echocardiography have been used as the gold standard since being described by Chin et al.(1) and later by Jenni et al.(2).  However, more recent advances in MR and CT imaging now allow for comparable if not superior imaging(3) of left\nventricular trabeculations characteristic of the disease, especially in the apical region.\n\nLVNC is underdiagnosed as a result of lack of knowledge about the disease and screening of relatives of those presenting with LVNC (4).  Though echocardiography has historically been the diagnostic test of choice, MR and more recently CT have been shown to be complimentary or superior in detecting the characteristic, 2-layered myocardium (5).  MR offers high quality images, preventing misdiagnosis of the characteristic trabeculations as apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or other cardiac pathology.  It allows for acquisition of images in any plane without limitations of acoustic windows and has been utilized to diagnose cases that went undetected by echocardiographic exam.\n\nMR has been found to be diagnostic of LVNC at a ratio of noncompacted to compacted myocardium > 2.3 at the end of diastole, with sensitivities and specificities of 84 and 99% (6).  Furthermore, MR delayed hyperenhancement correlates with degree of wall motion abnormality and has been found to be a positive independent predictor of ejection fraction and disease severity (7).  Others have used the ratio of 2.3 as the basis for CT diagnosis of LVNC (8-10), finding a good correlation to MR results.  CT is advantageous over other modalities in its ability to exclude anomalies of the coronary vasculature which have been described with LVNC (11).  This modality further demonstrates a high spatial and temporal resolution with quick acquisition of images as compared to MR (12).",

            "Disease Discussion": "Cancer of the ovary is the second most frequent gynecological malignancy in the United States.  It is, however, more deadly than all the other genital cancers combined.  More than three-fourths of patients already have extragonadal spread of the tumor to the pelvis or abdomen at the time of diagnosis.  It is most common between the ages of 40 and 60 and rare in those under 35.  By the time the carcinoma reaches 10-15 cm it often has already spread beyond the ovary and seeded the peritoneum.\n\nDistant metastasis, however, is unusual at presentation.  In fact, eighty-five percent of the time the disease remains confined to the peritoneal cavity throughout its course.  When it does metastasize, it tends to develop in the liver, lung or brain.  Metastasis to the pericardium, as in this case, is extremely rare.  \n\nWhile some contend that improving chemotheraputic treatments, particularly with drugs like cisplatin, has changed the pattern of metastasis by prolonging the disease, others report tumor behavior, and metastatic potential, is due to a specific molecular abnormality at the onset.  Perhaps there is some truth in both these schools of thought.   \n\nAs it is reported, aggressive ovarian cancers that tend to have distant metastasis are more frequently associated with having a null mutation of p53.  Sood et al. reports distant metastasis is nearly eight fold more frequent in tumors with this mutation than with any other.  His study also demonstrated that patients who had ovarian cancers with wild-type p53 or missense mutations did not present with distant metastasis.  \n\nAs radiologists, it is important for us to be careful when considering the likelihood of distant ovarian metastasis.  In light of a genetic work up suggesting distant metastasis potential, and corresponding radiological findings, regional versus systemic treatment modalities might improve quality and perhaps quantity of life.",

This immobilization is most often initiated in the field, which was not implemented in this patient. As soon as practical, and often before extrication is complete, the neck should be immobilized in a cervical collar, and the patient secured to a full-length backboard. The head is maintained in neutral position in the midline. Before transportation, the patient's body is securely strapped at all major joints, the head is taped to the board, and sandbags may be applied alongside the head. On arrival in the emergency department, the protective cocoon must be partially removed to allow assessment of the patient, but it is critical that the immobilization of the spine be maintained until an unstable injury has been ruled out both by radiologic and clinical examination. In the cervical spine, it is essential for the radiographs to include all seven cervical vertebrae, down to and including the articulation between C7 and T1. The lower portion of the cervical spine is often difficult to visualize well on lateral views, especially in large patients. If the region of C7 to T1 is not visualized, there is potential for dramatic missed injury. Under these circumstances, or if findings on plain films are equivocal, CT is a useful adjunct."

            "Disease Discussion": "The need for surgical intervention for injury to the spinal column itself is dictated by the degree of deformity and the perceived stability of the injury. Displaced fractures of the cervical spine are usually treated with careful application of traction, using a halo or Gardner-Wells tongs. Weight is gradually added to the traction apparatus until the spine is realigned. The rule of thumb is that a weight of approximately 5 pounds per cervical level is required for reduction. The neurologic examination must be followed very closely as weight is added to the traction. Serial radiographs are used to determine when adequate reduction has been obtained. Inability to obtain adequate reduction is usually an indication for surgical intervention.Those injuries thought to be relatively stable or with instability in only one column can be managed with immobilization only. For significant fractures this involves the use of a halo brace in the cervical spine, and an orthosis, usually a molded jacket, in the thoracic and lumbar spine. Unstable injuries usually require surgical stabilization. Stabilization can be achieved by placement of hardware posteriorly, by use of hardware and bone grafting anteriorly, or in some cases using both techniques simultaneously. The anterior approach allows better access to the vertebral body and better decompression of the spinal canal. Three-column injuries generally require both anterior and posterior stabilization.The benefits of early spinal stabilization in patients with complete injury are primarily related to the prevention of complications of long-term immobilization. Data show fewer complications in patients whose spinal injuries are fixed early, although there are no compelling survival differences. Therefore, spinal column injuries should be fixed as early as practical, once the patient is physiologically stable and no longer at risk to suffer deterioration of neurologic function, either from exacerbation of brain injury or as a result of manipulation of the spinal cord.",

Hartley in the American Journal of Otology, the inner ear anomaly described by Mondini consisted of:\n\n1) a cochlea of one-and-one-half turns instead of the normal two-and-one-half turns, comprising a normal basal turn and a cystic apex in place of the distal one-and-one-half turns; \n2) an enlarged vestibule with normal semicircular canals; and \n3) an enlarged vestibular aqueduct containing a dilated endolymphatic sac.  \n\nThus, the cochlear anomaly was relatively mild, and would correspond to incomplete partition in the spectrum of congenital cochlear malformation because of an arrest of embryogenesis.  Arrests at earlier stages in the spectrum include cochlear hypoplasia and common cavity and cochlear aplasia. Even earlier arrests result in otocyst and complete labyrinthine aplasia (Michel's anomaly).\n\nThe most common of the congenital cochlear deformities is Mondini's defect, which occurs late in auditory embryologic development, usually at 7 to 8 weeks.  The scala separations of the lumen of the cochlea are not developed completely at this point.  Essentially, Mondini's defect is incomplete development of the two-and-a-half turns of the cochlea.  The basal turn is relatively well formed, but the middle and apical turns are malformed.  Variations in the number of remaining turns in the cochlea comprise various types of otic dysplasia.  Enlargement of the vestibule is not an uncommon finding with cochlear abnormalities.  Enlargement of the endolymphatic sac in association with a large vestibular aqueduct is present in about 20% of Mondini malformations. \n\nRadiologically, the anomaly was recognized on polytomography by Jensen as early as 1969. Subsequently, he also described a more severe type of deformity consisting of an amorphous cochlear sac continuous with a dilated vestibule, for which he suggested the term \"dysplasia\". Unfortunately, the term \"Mondini dysplasia\" has come to mean virtually any congenital malformation of the osseous labyrinth detectable on radiographic examination.\n\nA recent retrospective review of temporal bone high-resolution CT findings was performed because it was realized that the term Mondini deformity was being used to describe two different types of incomplete partition of the cochlea. By taking inner ear measurements on radiologic findings they confirmed the presence of two different types of incomplete partition: IP-I (unpartitioned cochlea, cystic cochleovestibular malformation) and IP-II (incompletely partitioned cochlea, the classic Mondini deformity).\n\nIncomplete partition type I (unpartitioned cochlea, cystic cochleovestibular malformation) is defined as a malformation in which the cochlea lacks the entire modiolus and interscalar septa, resulting in a cystic appearance and there is an accompanying grossly dilated vestibule. Cochlear measurements show no significant difference from normal.\n\nThe type I malformation is less differentiated than the type II malformation.  Classic Mondini deformity has three components (a cystic apex, dilated vestibule, and large vestibular aqueduct), whereas type I malformation has an empty, unpartitioned cochlea and dilated vestibule without an enlarged vestibular aqueduct.  Classic Mondini deformity represents a later malformation, so the degree of dysplasia is milder than that in type I.",

            "Discussion": "Ultrasound-guided percutaneous renal biopsy using a spring loaded biopsy device is one of the most common methods used for renal biopsy (3). In a review of 1090 normotensive patients without coagulopathy who underwent the procedure between 1993 and 1997 the risk of post-biopsy minor hematoma formation was found to be 2.2% (3). More severe injuries such as loss of a kidney, life threatening hemorrhage, or persisting AV fistula have been reported but are considered exceedingly rare and did not occur in the study cited here. \n\nRenal injuries are typically classified in one of four radiologic categories (2):\n\nCategory I \u2013 Cortical Contusion; Subcapsular Hematoma; Minor Laceration with Mild Perinephric Hematoma; or Small Cortical Infarct (2).\n\nCategory II \u2013 Major Laceration with medullary involvement; Segmental Infarct (2). \n\nCategory III-  Multiple Renal Lacerations; Vascular Pedicle Injury (2).\n\nCategory IV-  UPJ Injury (2)\n\nIn evaluating a suspected renal injury, CT is the primary modality relied upon to detect and characterize a lesion (2). Using contrast enhanced CT, a renal injury such as a hematoma or laceration can be evaluated and the presence of active hemorrhage or urinary extravasation can frequently be documented (2).\n\nSubcapsular hematomas appear on CT imaging as a crescenteric enlargement surrounding all or a portion of the renal cortex (1). The density of these lesions varies depending upon injury maturity; hyperattenuating in earlier stages and becoming more hypoattenuating with time (1). Slight mass affect on the adjacent renal cortex may also be recognized (1). When the renal capsule is injured whether by blunt trauma or penetrating injury (as in this case by means of a biopsy needle), hematoma can enter the perinephric space (1). Hemorrhage in the perinephric space, when limited, appears similar to the subcapsular hematoma but demonstrates more ragged and heterogeneous margins.   \n\nMost subcapsular hematomas are managed conservatively (1). Only life threatening hemorrhage and impending circulatory collapse will prompt surgical exploration (1). \n\nThis patient was admitted to the hospital over night for close observation, following which he was discharged home with no untoward effects. \n\n\nReferences:\n\n1.

Most commonly this manifests as interstitial fibrosis.  Thickened sputum with associated mucous plugging and recurrent atelectasis, pneumonia, bronchitis or bronchiectasis is also seen.  Sjogren\u2019s patients are also at increased risk for developing non-Hodgkin\u2019s lymphoma and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis. \n\nLymphoma occurs in approximately 5-10% of Sjogren\u2019s patients. These lymphomas are mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Generally, there are no correlations with the severity or duration of Sjogren\u2019s and development of lymphoma.  Lymphoma should be suspected in patients with nodular or alveolar opacities and mediastinal lymph node involement.   \n\nLymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis or diffuse lymphoid hyperplasia is infiltration of the pulmonary interstitium by mature lymphocytes.

Spigelian hernias account for 2% of abdominal wall hernias. It is often missed or misdiagnosed and presents emergently with incarceration or strangulation in up to 25% of cases. There is no gender difference and the mean age at diagnosis is 50.\nSpigelian hernias can be congenital or acquired. Previous operations are found in 50% of all cases. Other factors mentioned are alterations in the tension of the abdominal wall aponeurosis produced by morbid obesity, multiple pregnancies, prostatic enlargement, or chronic pulmonary disease. Equally important seems to be rapid weight loss in obese patients.\nAlthough an SH can occur at any point along the semilunar line, 90% of them are found where the Spigelian fascia is broad and weak. This region, called the \u201cSpigelian belt\u201d (S belt), is a 6-cm horizontal transverse zone located within a plane between the umbilicus and a line joining both anterior iliac spines. \nDiagnosis will be virtually impossible unless the entity is previously considered.  Most patients present with unilateral abdominal pain and sensation of an abdominal wall mass.  Physical exam is of limited utility.  At the bedside, diagnosis and reduction with ultrasound guidance is sometimes attempted.

            "Title": "Bilateral Wilms' Tumor",
            "Disease Discussion": "Wilms' tumor is the most common primary renal malignancy and intra-abdominal tumor of childhood.  Ninety per cent occur in children less than 7 years of age, with a median age of 3-1/2 years.  The children are usually asymptomatic, most often presenting with clinical suspicion of an abdominal mass (approximately 70%).  Other symptoms include abdominal pain (30%), hematuria (15 to 20%), and less commonly with moderately severe hypertension and nonspecific constitutional symptoms (fever, malaise, gastrointestinal complaints).  There is a higher incidence of Wilms' tumor in patients with certain congenital abnormalities such as aniridia, hemi-hypertrophy, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, nephroblastomatosis, and various genitourinary abnormalities (hypoplasia, fusion, ectopia, duplicated collecting systems, hypospadias, and cryptorchidism).\n\nWilms' tumor is secondary to proliferation of metanephric blastema.  It is typically bulky and usually extends within the renal parenchyma, displacing and distorting the pelvocalyceal system.  However, the mass may be exophytic or may, although rarely, be extrarenal.  The outcome following multimodal therapy depends on the initial stage and whether or not the tumor has favorable or unfavorable histology for response to treatment.  The unfavorable types include anaplastic, sarcomatous, and rhabdoid types.\n\nThe following stages have been described for Wilms' tumor:\n\nI:  Tumor limited to kidney and completely resected, negative margins, intact renal capsule, not rupture.\n\nII:  Tumor extends beyond kidney, but completely excised, negative margins, regional infiltration, spillage.\n\nIII:  Residual nonhematogenous tumor, confined to abdomen including lymph nodes, peritoneal implants, incomplete excision.\n\nIV:  Hematogenous metastases beyond stage III, i.e., lung, liver, bone, brain.\n\nV:  Bilateral renal involvement, at time of diagnosis.\n\nWilms' tumor is bilateral (Stage V) in 5 to 10% at time of initial diagnosis.  In a patient with unilateral Wilms', a contralateral tumor may develop 5 to 10 years later, although the majority occur within 2 years.  The work-up should include a plain abdominal supine radiograph, not only to look for mass affect but also to look for calcifications, skeletal abnormalities, and paravertebral masses which may help in differentiating Wilms' tumor from neuroblastoma. \n\nThe next imaging study should be abdominal and pelvic sonography to determine the organ of origin, the size and extent of the mass, the characteristics of the mass (solid, cystic, complex calcifications), the presence of regional lymphadenopathy, liver metastases, tumor thrombus in the renal vein, inferior vena cava, and/or right atrium, and to look for bilaterality of the mass.  One should also look for any evidence of nephroblastomatosis which appears sonographically as hypoechoic masses in the periphery of the kidney, thickening of the renal capsule, or as nodularity or lobulation of the kidney.  This entity, which may be an anlage for Wilms' tumor, is much more easily seen with contrast- enhanced CT.  Duplex and/or color Doppler imaging are particularly helpful in the evaluation of the venous vasculature structures that may be involved with Wilms' tumor.  Wilms' tumor is most often a solid mass, although cystic spaces may often be seen within the mass due to internal hemorrhage and/or necrosis.  We have noted that some of the cystic spaces within Wilms' tumor are large venous channels due to arteriovenous shunting.\n\nDepending upon the sophistication of the ultrasound, one may choose to also obtain a baseline CT, unless nephroblastomatosis is suspected.  Certainly a baseline chest CT is recommended prior to surgery to look for pulmonary metastases.  During and after their treatment, sonography is an excellent noninvasive means of following the children.",

            "Title": "Epidermoid Tumor",
            "Disease Discussion": "Lesions/Condition: Epidermoid Tumor\n\nDiscussion:\n\nEpidermoid tumors typically occur between the ages of 20 and 60, with the peak incidence in the fourth decade, affecting both men and women equally.\n\nIntracranial epidermoid tumors are congenital inclusion cysts that comprise 1% of primary intracranial neoplasms.  They are thought to arise from the enclosure of ectodermal elements when the neural tube closes at 3-5 weeks gestation.  Additionally, acquired epidermoid tumors may occur as the result of trauma, although this is relatively uncommon in the brain.  Epidermoids are composed of an outer capsule of connective tissue that surrounds a layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and inner cystic fluid that includes debris, keratin, water, and cholesterol.  As the epithelial layer desquamates, the cells accumulate and form a cholesterol-rich layer that gives the tumor its characteristic pearly white appearance.  Epidermoids subtly grow within the CSF spaces, surrounding and encasing adjacent neurovascular structures.  The tumor has an irregular and lobulated cauliflower-like outer surface that shines like a \u201cmother of pearl.\u201d\n\nThe majority of intracranial epidermoid tumors are intradural lesions, in the basal subarachnoid spaces occurring off-midline.  Between 40%-50% of cases are found in the cerebellopontine angle cistern.  After schwannoma and meningioma, epidermoid tumors are the third most common cerebellopontine angle mass.  Epidermoid tumors also occur in the sellar and parasellar regions.  Less commonly, epidermoid tumors have been reported in the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and rarely in the lateral ventricles.  Approximately ten percent of epidermoid tumors are extradural, occurring in the skull or spine.\n\nEpidermoid tumors are benign slow-growing tumors, and malignant degeneration is extremely rare.  \n\nClinical Features:\n\nClinical features of epidermoid tumors are usually secondary to the mass effect of the tumor on adjacent structures.  Gait disturbance, cranial neuropathies, and occasionally seizures are presenting symptoms.  Hydrocephalus is not commonly seen with intracranial epidermoid tumors.   Additionally, symptoms related to chemical meningitis caused by leakage of tumor contents into the subarachnoid space may be seen.\n\nRadiology:\n\nEpidermoid tumors on CT are well-circumscribed, homogenous lobulated extra-axial masses, that are nonenhancing, and hypoattenuating, and are similar to CSF, secondary to the presence of solid cholesterol and/or loculated CSF within the tumor, and rarely demonstrate calcification.\n\nMR imaging is the best modality for evaluating these tumors.  Typically, epidermoid tumors demonstrate a lamellated appearance on MR imaging, secondary to the desquamated squamous epithelium.  Most epidermoid tumors have signal intensities that are near CSF signal, low to intermediate on T1 weighted images, and slightly hyperintense on T2 weighted images.  The main differential diagnostic consideration is that of an arachnoid cyst, with arachnoid cyst following the signal intensity patterns of CSF with all MR pulse sequences, whereas epidermoid tumors are not hypointense on FLAIR images and demonstrate areas of hyperintense signal relative to CSF.  Furthermore, on DW images, epidermoid tumors demonstrate restricted diffusion, which is not characteristic of arachnoid cysts.  Additionally, approximately 25% of epidermoid tumors will demonstrate a thin rim of peripheral enhancement following the administration of contrast material.  Furthermore, employing the use of a high resolution gradient-echo T2 sequence, such as 3D Fast Imaging Employing STeady-state Acquisition (FIESTA) the lamellated epidermoid tumor is clearly depicted as low signal intensity as it is contrasted against a hyperintense CSF background, achieving a precise preoperative assessment of surgical anatomy.\n\nFinally, the signal characteristics of epidermoid tumors vary depending on its composition.  Rarely, epidermoids will appear hyperattenuated on CT, secondary to elevated protein content, with reversal of signal characteristics on MR imaging, high signal intensity on T1WI, and low signal intensity on T2WI.  \n\nTreatment:  \n\nSubtotal resection is usually performed to alleviate compression of adjacent structures, and to avoid damaging vital structures.  The reported rate of recurrence of epidermoid tumors is highly variable.",

            "Disease Discussion": "In the United States and Canada, a large proportion of adults undergoing upper gastrointestinal barium radiographs are found to have a small hiatal hernia. About 90% to 95% of hiatal hernias found by radiograph are sliding hernias, and the rest are paraesophageal or mixed.  Most sliding hiatal hernias are small and of little clinical significance. Patients with symptomatic paraesophageal hernias are most often middle-aged to elderly.  Many patients with small, simple sliding hiatal hernias are asymptomatic. The main clinical significance of the sliding hiatal hernia is its contribution to gastroesophageal reflux . In addition to heartburn and regurgitation, patients with large sliding hiatal hernias may complain of dysphagia or discomfort in the chest or upper abdomen. In a prospective, population-based study the risk of iron-deficiency anemia was found to be increased  in adults with hiatal hernia. On chest radiograph a hiatal hernia may be noted as a soft tissue density in the retrocardiac area. Hiatal hernias are most often diagnosed on upper gastrointestinal barium radiographic studies. At endoscopy the gastroesophageal junction is noted to be proximal to the impression of the diaphragm. [1]\n\nPatients with paraesophageal and mixed hiatal hernias are rarely completely asymptomatic if closely questioned. About half of patients with paraesophageal hernias have gastroesophageal reflux. Other symptoms include dysphagia, chest pain, vague postprandial discomfort, and shortness of breath. A substantial number of patients have chronic gastrointestinal blood loss. If the hernia is complicated by gastric volvulus, acute abdominal pain and retching will occur, often progressing rapidly to a surgical emergency. A paraesophageal or mixed hiatal hernia may be seen on chest radiograph as an abnormal soft tissue density (often with a gas bubble) in the mediastinum. Upper gastrointestinal radiograph is the best diagnostic study. [1]\n\nHiatal hernias are occasionally complicated by volvulus. The stomach is normally fixed in position by ligamentous attachments to the duodenum, spleen, liver, and diaphragm. Laxity of these ligaments, elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, adhesions, gastric tumor, or masses in adjacent organs may predispose to volvulus. In about one third of cases the volvulus occurs below the diaphragm. In the other two thirds of cases volvulus occurs above the diaphragm in association with a diaphragmatic hernia. Sliding hiatal hernias are not associated with gastric volvulus.  Gastric volvulus may be mesenteroaxial or organoaxial. In about 60% of cases gastric volvulus is organoaxial: the stomach twists along its long axis. This axis usually passes through the gastroesophageal and gastropyloric junctions. The antrum rotates anteriorly and superiorly, the fundus posteriorly and inferiorly, twisting the greater curvature at some point along its length. This type of volvulus is commonly associated with a diaphragmatic hernia. Organoaxial volvulus is usually an acute event. Vascular compromise and gastric infarction may occur. The other major type of gastric volvulus is mesenteroaxial, in which the stomach folds on its short axis running across from the lesser curvature to the greater curvature, and the antrum twists anteriorly and superiorly. [1]\n\nSimple sliding hiatal hernias do not require treatment. Patients with symptomatic giant sliding hiatal hernias, paraesophageal, and mixed hernias should be offered surgery. Many experts suggest that surgery should be offered to patients with asymptomatic paraesophageal hernias, because about 30% of these patients will develop complications if left untreated. Many surgeons routinely perform a fundoplication on all repairs, both to prevent postoperative reflux esophagitis and to fix the stomach in the abdomen. Less commonly a gastrostomy is used to fix the stomach in position. Patients with sliding hiatal or paraesophageal hernias may have shortening of the esophagus. This makes it difficult to restore the gastroesophageal junction below the diaphragm without tension. In such cases an extra length of neoesophagus can be constructed from the proximal stomach (Colles-Nissen procedure). Paraesophageal and mixed hernias can be repaired through the chest or abdomen, with open or laparoscopic techniques. Compared with open repair, laparoscopic repair is associated with less blood loss, fewer overall complications, shorter hospital stay, and quicker return to normal activities. Long-term results are probably equal with either approach. Potential surgical complications include esophageal and gastric perforation, pneumothorax, and liver laceration. Potential long-term complications may include dysphagia if the wrap is too tight or gastroesophageal reflux if the fundoplication breaks down or migrates into the chest. Recurrence rates are about 10 [1]\n \n\n1.

The aberrant right subclavian artery forms secondary to the involution of a segment of the embryonic right 4th aortic arch, between the right subclavian and right common carotid arteries.  Thus, the right subclavian artery arises from the posterior medial wall of the aorta arch as the last branching vessel, crosses the retrotracheal space posterior to the esophagus, and lays anterolateral to the spine ascending on the right towards the thoracic inlet.  \n\nThis anomaly may go undetected on chest radiographs, and is incidentally detected on CT scans obtained for other reasons.  On the lateral chest radiograph, findings may be normal, or the anomalous artery will be visualized as an area of increased density in the retrotracheal space, with a focal impression upon the posterior wall of the trachea.  The posteroanterior chest radiograph will demonstrate an area of increased soft-tissue density in the right paratracheal region.\n\nAdditionally, at the point of origin the artery may arise from an aortic diverticulum (Kommerell diverticulum) potentially causing compression of the esophagus and inducing symptoms of dysphagia (\u201cdysphagia lusoria\u201d or \u201cdysphagia by freak of nature\u201d as described by Dr. David Bayford in 1794), most often in the elderly.",

Most patients with duplex collecting systems are asymptomatic (abnormalities are usually noted incidentally), but it is important to note that duplex systems are more likely to be associated with ureteropelvic obstruction, reflux, and infections. \n\nVarious imaging modalities may be useful in suggesting duplication, but CT is the superior modality for diagnosis.  Plain films will usually exhibit a duplex kidney which is longer than the nonduplex kidney (1-3 cm longer), but this is nonspecific.  Excretory urography may further characterize the renal anatomy and delineate anomalies, but may also prove difficult in discerning obstruction versus renal mass.  The use of ultrasound may show the presence of two collecting systems with intervening parenchyma, but does not rule out an intrarenal mass.  CT, however,  is useful in detecting obstruction and further characterizing the renal parenchyma.  It may also be valuable in illustrating partial versus complete duplication of ureters and ureter insertion points in the bladder.

            "Disease Discussion": "Renal cancer is the seventh leading malignant condition affecting men and the twelfth among women.(1)  Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) arises from the renal tubular epithelium, and accounts for approximately eighty-five percent of renal cancers.  The classic triad presentation of RCC includes flank pain, hematuria and a palpable abdominal mass.  These three findings are only seen in approximately ten percent of cases, and currently most cases are detected incidentally on imaging studies.  Gross or microscopic hematuria is the most reliable symptom, but may be intermittent indicating the neoplasm may remain silent until it attains a particular size.  Therefore, imaging studies of the genitourinary tract should be performed on any patient older than forty years of age with hematuria.\n\nTraditionally, RCC has been classified based on histology.  In the past two decades, molecular genetic investigations of RCC have led to recurring chromosomal abnormalities occurring with specific RCC histological subtypes.  Therefore, in 2004, the World Health Organization (WHO) integrated these consistent genetic abnormalities into the previous classification of renal neoplasms.  Moreover, observations have indicated associated inherited cancer syndromes, which were reflected in the new WHO classification system.  Of these subtypes, the most relevant subtypes include:  Clear Cell (conventional), Papillary and Chromophobe, accounting for approximately seventy percent, fifteen to twenty percent, and five to ten percent of renal neoplasms, respectively.(1)  The remaining subtypes are extremely less common.\n\nClear cell renal carcinoma (Figure 4), usually occurs as a solitary unilateral lesion from the proximal tubular epithelium.  The growth pattern can be varied, but ranges from solid, trabecular or tubular.  Histologically, the cells can have a rounded or polygonal shape, with clear or granular cytoplasm.  The neoplastic cells have intracytoplasmic glycogen and lipids, which are dissolved during the preparation of the biopsy, giving the cells their clear appearance seen microscopically.  The lipid containing cells in this subtype give the neoplasm its classic golden/yellow color on gross observation.(2)\n\nPapillary carcinoma (Figure 3) is characterized by a papillary growth pattern, with the papillary projections having a fibrovascular core consisting of foamy macrophages.  There are two subtypes of papillary carcinoma recognized and  differentiated by histomorphological characteristics.  Type I neoplasms have a monolayer of cells with little cytoplasm.  Type II neoplasms have an abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and typically distinct nucleoli.(3)\n\nChromophobe renal carcinoma (Figure 5) is usually situated around blood vessels arranged in sheets.  This neoplasm is composed of pale eosinophilic cells, often with a perinuclear halo.  Abrahams et al found accentuated cell borders and a combination of hyperchromatic wrinkled nuclei, and perinuclear halos were the three most often associated histological features associated with this subtype.(4)\tCollecting duct renal carcinoma (CDC), or Bellini duct carcinoma, is an extremely rare entity, accounting for less than one percent of renal neoplasms.  The neoplasm is located centrally with a gray appearance.  Its borders are irregular and infiltrative with a so-called hobnail pattern. This subtype has been shown to have various histological patterns within a single neoplasm ranging from duct-like to papillary architecture, and therefore has been known to be misdiagnosed.  This disease usually is diagnosed in advanced stage, and with its high rate of metastasis has a dismal prognosis.(5)\n\nRenal medullary carcinoma (RMC) is an extremely rare entity and associated with the sickle cell trait.  Histologically, the neoplasm resembles CDC and grossly resembles urothelial carcinoma by its location, pattern and grade.  RMC can be arranged in solid sheets, but usually in a reticular pattern with yolk sac-like areas.  Furthermore, this neoplasm is typically found in the age range between ten to forty years with a male predominance.(1,2)",

            "Title": "Empyema",
            "Disease Discussion": "A parapneumonic effusion is any pleural effusion associated with suppurative parenchymal lung disease. Simple parapneumonic effusions are uninfected, free-flowing fluid collections. Complicated parapneumonic effusions are early infected fluid collections prone to develop loculations by fibrinous septations. Empyema is a collection of frank pus within the pleural space. An effusion is termed complex when it develops loculations. The natural evolution of untreated simple and complicated parapneumonic effusions is to become complex and to progress to frank empyema with development of a residual cavity or entrapment of the lung by a fibrous peel or cortex.\n\nPneumonia results in parapneumonic effusion in approximately 45% of cases, although less than 5% of these progress to an empyema. Other common causes include mediastinal or pulmonary surgery and trauma. Less frequently, empyema may result from spread of infection from adjacent structures. Mortality from empyema ranges from 1% to 20%. \n\nClinical manifestations vary, depending on the underlying pulmonary process, the responsible organism, the quantity of bacteria and fluid in the pleural space, the stage of the disease, and the host defense mechanisms. The clinical presentation can range from an absence of symptoms to a severe febrile illness with toxemia and shock. In general, it is difficult to distinguish patients with infected pleural effusions from those with sterile parapneumonic effusions on the basis of history and physical examination alone. Clinical manifestations include fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough with mucopurulent sputum. Physical examination often reveals decreased breath sounds, dull percussion, and restricted respiratory excursions. \n\nWith the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-1940s, a significant shift occurred in the microbiology of pleural space infections. Anaerobic organisms are now the most common bacteria isolated from infected pleural effusions, being identified in up to 75% of cases, either alone (35%) or in combination with aerobic organisms (40%). Up to 35% of established empyemas have negative Gram stain evaluations and many patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions have negative culture results. Staphylococcus aureus is a relatively common cause of empyema in otherwise healthy adults, children and in patients who have had chest trauma or prior surgery, whereas alcoholic males are particularly susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. \n\nThoracentesis plays a critical role in the management of pleural effusions and in 90% of adult cases yields useful information. Fluid is removed and samples obtained for measurement of pH, glucose, LDH, protein, and differential cell count. An exudate is defined by: (1) a ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein greater than 0.5, (2) a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH greater than 0.6, or (3) a pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds of the upper normal limit for serum or >200 IU [3] . A transudate does not meet any of the above three criteria. \n\nIf the patient has a transudative effusion, no further laboratory tests on the pleural fluid are indicated. If the patient has an exudative pleural effusion, the remaining pleural fluid is sent for WBC and differential, cytologic examination, Gram's stain and cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacteria and fungi if clinically indicated. The aspiration of frank pus confirms the presence of empyema and establishes an absolute indication for urgent drainage of the pleural space. In this instance, Gram's stain and culture are the only laboratory studies necessary to guide initial therapy. Pleural fluid Gram's stains can identify pathogens in 55% to 65% of patients with established empyemas. \nThe posterior-anterior and lateral chest radiographs are the best initial diagnostic modalities. When the patient is upright, free pleural fluid first accumulates in the lowest part of the hemithorax\u2014the posterior costophrenic angles. Lateral decubitus views allow detection of 50 to 100 ml of fluid and the presence of loculations if the fluid fails to layer out along the dependent chest. In the view with the involved side superior, the free fluid layers against the mediastinum and one can assess how much of the radiodensity is due to the fluid and how much is due to a parenchymal infiltrate. In the view with the involved side dependent, the amount of free pleural fluid can be semi-quantitated by measuring the distance from the chest wall to the outside of the lung. If the thickness of fluid exceeds 10 mm, a diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated. However, it is not necessary to tap all parapneumonic effusions, especially if the volume of fluid remains small, the patient is doing well, the fluid moves freely, or serial roentgenograms show improvement. \n\nCT is of great value in the overall evaluation of parapneumonic effusions and should be done early in the assessment of patients with complex parapneumonic effusion or empyema. CT is helpful in (1) differentiating pleural fluid from peripheral parenchymal infiltrates or pleural thickening, (2) evaluating the parenchymal disease, (3) determining the presence of loculations, (4) characterizing the pleural surfaces, and (5) guiding and assessing therapy. Complicated effusions and empyemas are frequently associated with nearby pulmonary consolidation and can be mistaken for a lung abscess. A lung abscess usually presents as a poorly defined, roughly spherical mass surrounded by consolidated but non compressed lung. An empyema is usually elongated, conforms to the shape of the chest wall, and compresses the adjacent lung. Its wall is thin and uniform and the interface angle with the chest wall is obtuse. The margins of the empyema cavity are composed of inflamed visceral and parietal pleura that enhance after administration of intravenous contrast. The visceral and parietal layers are separated by the interposed empyema fluid, giving rise to the \u201csplit pleura sign\u201d.\n\nUS is widely available, provides guidance for thoracentesis or pleural catheter placement, and can be transported to the bedside. US is particularly useful for sampling fluid that does not layer freely on decubitus films, and can distinguish solid from liquid pleural abnormalities better than chest roentgenography. The presence of discrete pleural septations has prognostic importance because loculated collections require drainage for their resolution. Computed tomography, however, gives additional information not obtained by US.\n\nThe sine qua non of empyema management is early, adequate, and dependent drainage. The therapeutic armamentarium for parapneumonic effusion or empyema consists of antibiotic therapy, thoracentesis, chest tube drainage, image-guided percutaneous catheter drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic agents, and a variety of surgical drainage procedures, including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy.",

            "Discussion": "Renal cell carcinoma, the most common primary tumor of the kidney, is found incidentally in many patients with the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging.  In fact, as many as one-half of renal cell carcinomas are discovered incidentally at early stages when they are asymptomatic.  CT has also played an essential role in staging renal cell carcinoma in order to guide prognosis and surgical planning.  The patient in this case underwent partial nephrectomy for his renal cell carcinoma.  As a result, this case generates several interesting questions.  What is the standard protocol for staging renal cell carcinoma with CT?  What staging systems exist for renal cell carcinoma and what are their differences?  Finally, what factors determine the use of radical nephrectomy versus nephron-sparing surgical techniques?\n\t\nOnce a renal cell carcinoma is suspected incidentally, there is a standard protocol for work-up using CT.  First, an unenhanced CT is preformed to use as a baseline once intravenous contrast material is administered.  Due to a significant vascular supply, renal cell carcinomas enhance following administration of contrast.  12 HU of enhancement suggest possible malignancy.  Following the administration of contrast, images are obtained during the corticomedullary phase, nephrographic phase, and excretory phase.  \n      \nThe corticomedullary phase occurs between 25 and 70 seconds after injection and primarily enhances the renal cortex.  While not perfect for detecting small lesions, this phase can aid in diagnosing venous extension of the tumor.  The nephrographic phase, which occurs between 80 and 180 seconds following injection, is best for detecting renal masses and analyzing indeterminate lesions.  Finally, the excretory phase begins 180 seconds following injection and helps evaluate the collecting system, as well as the calices and renal pelvis.  \n     \n Renal cell carcinoma has two potential staging systems: the Robson classification and the TMN classification.  CT is reported to be 91% accurate in staging renal cell carcinoma.  The TMN classification is considered more precise because of its clear definition of the anatomic extent of the tumor.  With respect to the TMN classification, T1 is reserved for tumors less than 7 cm and T2 for tumors greater than 7 cm.  T3 is broken down into three groups based on tumor position.  T3a indicates spread to the perinephric fat.  T3b indicates that the tumor is present in the renal vein only.  T3c describes a tumor in the infradiaphragmatic IVC.  T4a and T4b describe tumors with direct invasion of adjacent organs and presence in the supradiaphragmatic IVC, respectively.  N1-3 are reserved for regional lymph node metastases and M1a-d for distant metastases.  \n    \nThe Robson classification is staged I-IV.  I is given to a tumor confined within the renal capsule.  II indicates spread to the perinephric fat.  IIIA describes the presence of a venous thrombus, whereas IIIB describes regional lymph node metastases.  IVA indicates direct invasion of adjacent organs and IVB indicates distant metastases.  An important downfall of the Robson classification is that it uses stage III to describe both patients with venous extension alone and patients with regional lymph node metastases.  The treatment for these two groups of patients varies significantly.  Venous extension of the tumor can be treated surgically, whereas lymph node metastases indicate a need for palliative therapy.  \n     \nDue to the rapid increase in incidental discovery of renal cell carcinoma, many tumors are small in size and early-stage.  Therefore, nephron-sparing surgery is often an option.  The procedure consists of excision of the renal tumor and obtaining 0.5 cm margins of normal renal tissue and preserving the largest amount of functioning renal parenchyma.  This procedure is particularly desirable when radical nephrectomy would lead to dialysis.  Therefore, it is indicated in patients with a solitary functioning kidney, compromised renal function, or bilateral tumors.  In addition, data indicates that small <4 cm in diameter lesions, which are polar, cortical, and a safe distance away from the renal hilum and collecting systems, have similar survival rates for the nephron-sparing procedure and radical nephrectomy.  The size and position of the patient\u2019s tumor in this case made him a good candidate for the nephron-sparing procedure."

            "Disease Discussion": "Renal cell carcinoma is the most common primary tumor of the kidney and accounts for 2.6 percent of all adult cancers.  While the cause is unknown, cigarette smoking has been identified as an environmental risk factor.  Sporadic tumors are most common, but familial settings, such as von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, have been identified.  The carcinoma develops from the proximal tubule cells of the kidney.  Clear cell, papillary, chromophobe, collecting duct, and sarcomatoid are the different histologic types.  These different patterns do not affect treatment.  \n\nRenal cell carcinoma has two potential staging systems: the Robson classification and the TMN classification.  CT is reported to be 91% accurate in staging renal cell carcinoma.  The TMN classification is considered more precise because of its clear definition of the anatomic extent of the tumor.

IVA indicates direct invasion of adjacent organs and IVB indicates distant metastases.  \n\nThe common presentation of renal cell carcinoma includes gross or microscopic hematuria, flank pain or pass, systemic symptoms, or a solid renal mass on imaging.  \n\nMany renal cell carcinomas are found incidentally on imaging.  CT is the most valuable imaging modality.  It can confirm the nature of the mass and stage the tumor by providing visualization of the lymph nodes, renal vein, and hepatic involvement.  The contralateral kidney and other body organs can also be examined.  \n\nTreatment for renal cell carcinoma  varies based on the patient.  Radical nephrectomy is common for a localized renal cell carcinoma.  The indications for partial nephrectomy are reviewed in the discussion.  Radiofrequency and cryosurgical ablation are new techniques being studied.  Chemotherapy is not effective in treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Cryoreductive nephrectomy is recommended for patients who are in good status and have metastatic primary disease.  Disease-free five-year survival is 90-100 percent for patients with tumors confined by the renal capsule.  Tumors extending beyond the capsule have a 50-60 percent rate of disease-free five-year survival.  The five-year disease-free survival drops to 0-15 percent for node-positive tumors.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Intraosseous lipomas are benign bone lesions that are histologically identical to extraosseous lipomas.  They are comprised of mature adipose cells separated into lobules by fibrovascular septations.  Patients may present with or without localized pain of variable duration and a variable amount of soft tissue swelling.  Many of these lesions are discovered incidentally.  Intraosseous lipomas may be seen in patients of all ages, with a predilection for young to middle age adults.  They are most commonly detected in the metaphysis or epiphysis of the long bones of the lower extremity with 50% involving the femur, tibia, and fibula.  These tumors may also be found in other long bones, the skull and jaws, ribs, pelvis, and frequently (15%) in the calcaneus, which is the most common tarsal bone involved.\n\nThe typical plain film appearance of intraosseous lipomas is a geographic, well marginated, osteolytic lesion with a thin sclerotic rim.  Lobulations at the margins or internal osseous ridges are common as is a central nidus of dystrophic calcification, which is nearly pathognomonic for this tumor.  This central calcification is secondary to fat necrosis.  Osseous expansion may be evident, especially in bones of small caliber.  Computed tomography demonstrates attenuation similar to subcutaneous fat with regions of cystic changes. The differential diagnosis includes simple bone cyst (unicameral), fibrous dysplasia, and when calcified, enchondroma and clear cell chondrosarcoma.  Bone infarct is also a diagnostic consideration.   If the lesion is in the calcaneous, normal trabecular variation (pseudocyst) secondary to the absence of stress and resulting atrophy of bony trabeculation should be considered.  \n\nMRI findings are pathognomonic.  Lesions include regions of fat with high signal intensity on T1 weighted sequences and low signal intensity on T2 weighted fat suppressed and STIR sequences.  This may be combined with internal areas of low signal calcification and peripheral thick or thin rims of low signal sclerosis.  On T1 weighted MR images, the homogenous high signal intensity of the lipoma is demarcated from the fat in the bone marrow by a sharp margined rim of low signal intensity.  A dark, central focus is commonly seen and corresponds to dystrophic calcification.",

They are more common in females, whites, premature infants, and twins.  \n\nAt birth these lesions can be small and inconspicuous, with 60% absent at birth.  The natural history is a two stage process of proliferation and regression.  The typical hemangioma will begin to involute by 10 months of age, with half of all lesions having resolved by 5 years.\n\nClinically, hemangiomas appear as erythematous or blanching macules, or appear as a small telangiectasia.  The clinical appearance depends upon the degree of dermal involvement and lesion depth.  Lesions involving the skin have a more characteristic strawberry appearance.  Deeper lesions demonstrate a blue appearance.  \n\nMost hemangiomas are generally treated conservatively. Corticosteroids are the first line of treatment for problematic infantile capillary hemangiomas.  Other options include interferon alpha and vincristine.  Propranolol has also been observed to inhibit growth. While the mechanism of action is unclear, potential explanations include vasoconstriction; down-regulation of the RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; and the triggering of apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells. \n\nCapillary hemangiomas can develop life threatening complications, such as consumptive coagulopathy, compression of vital structures, and bleeding secondary to fissure or ulcer formation."

            "Disease Discussion": "Overall, hemangiomas are present in 10-12% of Caucasian children - mostly as cutaneous lesions, often called \"strawberry marks\". \n\nIntra orbital vascular lesions account for 5-20% of all orbital masses in children.  Some of these are neoplastic (capillary hemangioma) while others are malformations including venous varices and cavernous hemangioma.  Capillary hemangiomas are composed of variably sized vascular spaces that are lined by proliferating endothelial cells.  Capillary hemangiomas have been reported as the most common vascular tumor of the orbit, representing 5-12% of pediatric orbital lesions.  \n\nMultiple synonyms have been used for these lesions, including infantile hemangioma, benign hemangioendothelioma,  and hemangioblastoma.  However, these terms are neither distinctive nor accurate and the most commonly used term is \u201ccapillary hemangioma\u201d \u2013 to allow distinction from the \u201ccavernous hemangioma\u201d (AKA \u201ccavernoma\u201d, cavernous malformation).  The cavernous hemangioma is one of the most common orbital masses in the adult patient.  The latter process is malformative and not neoplastic. [Mulliken 1982 PMID: 7063565] \n\nOrbital hemangiomas have been reported in association with PHACES (Posterior fossa malformations, Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects and coarctation of the Aorta, Eye abnormalities, and Sternal abnormalities or ventral developmental defects); and also with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. [McCannel 1996 PMID: 8643250]\n\nOrbital capillary hemangiomas (OCH) may be supplied either by branches of the internal (e.g. ophthalmic) or external carotid artery, and may extend intracranially through the superior orbital fissure or optic canal.\n\n\u2022  Clinical\nOrbital capillary hemangioma (from now on just \u201chemangioma\u201d) present as sporadic lesions in childhood, with approximately 1/3 as congenital lesions noted at birth.  The majority will present during the first decade.  Almost half of them may enlarge during a Valsalva maneuver or with crying.  There is a slight female predilection of 3:2 over males vs. up to 3:1 for cutaneous hemangioma.  These endothelial vascular neoplasms typically proliferate in the first few months after presentation; and, then most stabilize \u2013 often at an alarming size.  The natural history in most patients is for the lesions to stabilize for a period of years, and then begin spontaneous involution in adolescence, typically from 4-8 years of age.  Some cases have been followed for up to 18 years, with eventual spontaneous but slow involution. [Henderson JW Ophthalmology 1990 - PMID: 2342808]\n\nIn addition to the obvious facial discoloration and mass, capillary hemangiomas may interfere with vision, cause proptosis, diplopia or amblyopia, and even optic atrophy.  [Yap EY 1998 - PMID: 9703301]\n\n\u2022  Gross Pathology\nThese lesions are usually ruby-red soft, rounded and occasionally lobulated masses.  Lesions with skin or subcutaneous involvement are often called \u201cstrawberry\u201d lesions due to their red color.\n\n\n\u2022  Histology\nThese lesions are usually well demarcated from surrounding tissues.  The histology varies with the phase of the lesion.  In younger patients, while the lesions are \u201cactive\u201d or growing, histology shows mitotic activity from plump proliferating endothelial cells that surround small irregular vascular spaces.  Mast cells may be increased within the lesion.  Classically, involution begins within the center of the mass, and the advances outward.  Fatty and fibrous tissue surround the vascular space; and, the fibro-fatty tissue eventually replaced the vascular stroma.  These features allow distinction from cavernous hemangiomas, that have larger vascular spaces that are lined by flattened endothelial cells.\n\n\n\u2022  Imaging\n\u00bb US\nUltrasound may play a dual role in capillary hemangioma \u2013 demonstrating the lesions as well as documenting their vascularity.  [Verity DH EYE 2006 - PMID: 17019424]  US shows great variability in lesion appearance, but can well document high-velocity flow in (100-1000 times normal) in feeding vessels.  [Verity2006]  Lesion involution is often preceded by stabilization in the rate of flow increase.  Although US can be used to follow the progression-regression sequence in these tumors, MR provides the best evaluation in the diagnostic phase. \n\n\u00bb CT\nThe appearance of orbital capillary hemangiomas varies over time.  Most commonly during the growing phase, they will appear as intensely enhancing lesions, that may be either well demarcated or poorly marginated.  Lesions may be more dense than brain (50-60 HU) due to the blood filled vascular spaces.  In the involution phase, the attenuation of the lesion will decrease, as fibro-fatty tissue replaces the vascularity.\n\n\u00bb MR\nThese lesions are usually well demarcated discrete lobulated masses with internal septations.  They are usually dark on T1W and become hyperintense with T2-weighting.  Bright contrast enhancement after Gadolinium is almost universal in these lesions.  As these lesions involute, fatty and fibrous tissue may replace the tumor and the lesion may show areas of T1 shortening.\n\n\u00bb Treatment and Prognosis\nThe majority of these lesions will undergo spontaneous regression as the child ages.  About one-half will show involution by age 5, and the overwhelming majority will show clear signs of involution by seven or eight years.  Lesions that present at younger ages may also regress earlier in the life of the child.  Both oral and parenteral steroids, interferon therapy, and surgery may be used when vision is threatened by periocular lesions.  Fractionated stereotactic radiation may have potential benefit in some cases that do not regress or are not amenable to surgery.  [Tsao MN J. Neurosurgery 2003 - PMID: 12546367]",

            "Disease Discussion": "Melanoma of the uveal tract is the most common primary  intraocular malignancy in adults. The age range of presentation is typically 50 to 70 years old and unilateral ocular symptoms is the most common presentation. The diagnosis can be made with high sensitivity with combined ophthalmoscopic examination and ocular ultrasound. CT or MRI are used to supplement this evaluation if ocular clouding prevents a clear view of the lesion and may be used to follow response to treatment or progression of the tumor.\n\nThe tumor is unilateral and 85% of lesions arise from the choroidal portion of the uvea, with 9% arising from the ciliary body and 6% arising from the iris.  Congenital melanosis, ocular melancytosis, oculodermal melanocytosis, and uveal nevi are predisposing conditions. The lesion may cause a retinal detachment and hemorrhage.\n\nCT features of the tumor demonstrate a soft tissue mass which is high density on noncontrast images, which enhances with contrast. The mass arises from the layer of tissue just deep to the external tissue of the globe and usually bulges inward toward the vitreous. The lesion may be small and flat in its early stages but may grow into a mushroom shaped intraocular tumor.  CT or MRI may also demonstrate extraocular invasion which is associated with a poorer prognosis. \n\nThe lesion has unique MRI features in that the tumor is typically hyperintense on T1W sequences and hypointense on T2W sequences due to melanin content. The lesion is usually sharply circumscribed on MRI images. \n\nDifferential diagnosis of a unilateral ocular lesion include ocular metastases, choroidal hemangioma, retinal detachment with hemorrhage, and fat. \n\nTherapeutic options include enucleation, eye-sparing tumor excision, and radiation therapy.",

            "Title": "Sacrococcygeal teratoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "This is an unusual case of a cystic sacrococcygeal teratoma.  Sacrococcygeal teratoma occurs in approximately 1 in 35,000 births but is reportedly the most common tumor encountered among neonates.  The prenatal diagnosis of sacrococcygeal teratoma carries a very low rate of malignancy.  However, the size and extension of the tumor is more important than the histology in prenatal studies.  It may be mainly exterior with only a minimal presacral component, predominantly external with a significant intrapelvic component, predominantly internal with intra-abdominal extension, or entirely internal with no external component.  The majority of sacrococcygeal teratomas are solid or mixed cystic and solid; only 15% are entirely cystic (as in this case).  An intra-abdominal component often displaces the urinary bladder anteriorly and may obstruct the ureters.\n\nThe differential diagnosis depends on whether the mass is predominantly solid or cystic and external or internal.  Other solid or complex masses in the sacrococcygeal region include chordoma, neurogenic tumor, lipoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, hemangioma, malignant melanoma, and meconium pseudocyst extending into the solid tissues.  A predominantly or entirely cystic mass may resemble a myelomeningocele, which must be excluded by demonstrating intact posterior spinal elements.  However, the teratoma may extend into the lumbosacral canal, and sacrococcygeal teratoma may occur with associated vertebral anomalies which make this distinction very difficult.  The differential diagnosis for an entirely intra-abdominal sacrococcygeal teratoma includes ovarian cyst, meconium pseudocyst, enteric duplication cyst, or other bowel-related abnormality.\n\nApproximately 25% of fetuses with sacrococcygeal teratoma develop hydrops, probably secondary to the vascularity of the tumor.  Because of the risk of dystocia and traumatic hemorrhage into the tumor, Cesarean delivery has been recommended for tumors larger than 5 cm.  A predominantly cystic mass may undergo in utero aspiration immediately prior to vaginal delivery, as was accomplished in this case.",

            "Title": "Fronto-nasal encephalocele",
            "Disease Discussion": "The term cephalocele refers to a defect in the skull and dura with extracranial extension of intracranial structures.  The term encephalocele refers to herniation of both brain tissue and meninges through the skull defect, whereas the term meningocele refers to herniation of the meninges only.  Both the skull defect and herniation are more common in the midline.  \n\nMost encephaloceles are easily recognized by the clinician.  On initial examination, the patient has a large midline extracranial mass that is soft to palpation.  In patients with obvious masses such as these, the imaging study is obtained to look for associated brain anomalies that may alter the child's prognosis.  An example of such an associated anomaly is shown in Films .3 - .6.  This patient with a large frontal encephalocele also has agenesis of the corpus callosum and multiple gray matter heterotopias in the subependymal region.  The absence of the corpus callosum can be detected on both the sagittal images by the absence of the corpus on the midline image and on the axial images by the characteristic shape of the frontal horns and the parallel lateral ventricles.\n\nAnother reason to obtain imaging studies in patients with encephaloceles is to look for the location of the major vascular structures of the brain.  Particularly, because most encephaloceles are in the midline, the torcula and the superior sagittal sinus are crucial structures that must be located.  In Films .7 - .9, a parietal encephalocele is shown.  This case has two very important findings.  The first is the deformity of the brain in the region of the encephalocele.  Notice how the midbrain and cerebellum are stretched toward the calvarial defect.  This stretching results from the pulsations of the brain causing it to be pushed out of the calvarial defect.  The immature brain (before myelination) is very soft and easily deformed.  Therefore it can be molded into just about any shape.  It is common to see this sort of stretching of brain toward the skull defect in patients with encephaloceles.  The other important feature of this case is the position of the superior sagittal sinus.  On sequential coronal films, going from front to back, the sagittal sinus can be visualized in its entirety in relation to the encephalocele.  Arrows point to the sinus as it courses within the most inferior and lateral aspect of the sac on the right.  Notice that the sinus would be outside of the calvarium if the calvarium were present.  More posteriorly, the torcula is high and the straight sinuses are seen to course steeply inferiorly within the walls of the tentorium cerebellum (arrows).  The steep leaves of the tentorium probably result from the same process that causes herniation of the midbrain and cerebellum into the calvarial defect.  \n\nSpecial mention should be made of sphenoidal and fronto-nasal encephaloceles because they are often clinically occult at birth.  A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of encephalocele in adolescents and young adults who present with nasal or nasopharyngeal masses.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Brain stem neoplasms are uncommon, accounting for 10-15% of CNS tumors in children, with a peak age at presentation of less than 14  years.   Most are gliomas, including slow-growing fibrillary or pilocytic  astrocytoma,  malignant  astrocytoma,  and glioblastoma multiforme.    These tumors may initially infiltrate the brain stem pathways without tissue destruction, and few deficits  may  be  present,  in spite  of  extensive  disease at the time of diagnosis.  Presenting complaints include cranial nerve deficits, disturbances of motor or sensory  pathways,  ataxia,  abnormal eye movements, somnolence, or hyperactivity.  Hydrocephalus is characteristically a late finding, with the exception of those tumors arising in  immediate  proximity to the aqueduct.  \n\nOn  CT,  these  tumors infiltrate and enlarge the brain stem and secondarily displace the fourth ventricle.  They commonly are hypodense but occasionally are of increased density compared to normal brain as seen on Film .3 in a different child.   Calcification  and cyst   formation  are  infrequent  (12%),  and  approximately  half demonstrate enhancement after contrast (Film .4).    When  present, enhancement  patterns  are variable, with diffuse, nodular, or ring enhancement seen.  A small number of these tumors  may  demonstrate exophytic  growth  into  the posterior fossa cisterns, particularly the cerebellopontine angle cistern.  These tumors tend  to  enhance with contrast administration.    \n\nBecause  of Hounsfield artifact in the posterior fossa, a small percentage of brain stem gliomas will be overlooked  on  initial  CT scans.    The  superior imaging capability of MRI for brain stem and posterior fossa pathology allows recognition  and  characterization of  lesions  that  are poorly delineated by CT, such as isodense or nonenhancing tumors.   \n\nBrain stem gliomas, particularly those arising in the pons, have a  relentlessly progressive course with little improvement in spite of radiation therapy.  A subgroup of brain stem glioma consisting of localized small masses at the cervicomedullary junction have a more benign course and may potentially benefit from surgical resection. Attempts  at  surgical resection otherwise have not proven beneficial.  Differential diagnosis includes  non- neoplastic  diseases  of the  brain stem such as demyelinating diseases (multiple sclerosis), encephalitis, and  infarction.    Exophytic  and  enhancing  masses occasionally mimic medulloblastoma or ependymoma.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is an inflammatory process which may involve all or segments of the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary ductal system.  It is an idiopathic disease most often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis and less often Crohn\u2019s disease. It less frequently associated with Reidel\u2019s thyroiditis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, or mediastinal fibrosis. The disease is more common in males than females with a 3:1 incidence ratio. The estimated prevalence in Western countries is 6 to 8 cases per 100,000 persons.\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of PSC, however, it is remains an idiopathic disease. Bile duct walls become progressively inflamed and thickened and the degree of severity may vary segmentally.  There is typically alternating dilatation and stricturing of the involved ducts. The disease usually involves both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. It is characterized by progressive destruction of bile ducts, which may result in the development of biliary cirrhosis. It was previously thought to be a rare disorder, however, now PSC is one of the more common indications for liver transplantation.\n\nThe main symptoms of PSC include pruritis, jaundice, abdominal pain, and fatigue. However, as many as 44% of patients may be asymptomatic at presentation. Patients may also experience repeated episodes of bacterial cholangitis and have an increased tendency to develop pigmented biliary stones. Steatorrhea and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins may occur. Cholangiocarcinoma may occur in up to 30% of PSC patients.  2% of patient\u2019s may also develop hepatocellular carcinoma. \n\nThe diagnosis of PSC is based on characteristic ERCP findings in combination with laboratory, histologic, and clinical findings. It is important to exclude secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis, such as prior surgeries, choledocolithiasis, chronic bacterial cholangitis and biliary neoplasms. The typical  ERCP findings of PSC include multifocal strictures and dilatations that have a beaded appearance. Biliary diverticulae may also be present. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are usually involved, but either alone may be affected. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) also shows promise as a valuable technique in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with PSC and MRCP may be superior to ERCP for the demonstration of intrahepatic ductal findings. CT and ultrasonography play a more limited role in the diagnosis or followup of PSC  and demonstrate nonspecific findings. \n\nMany modalities have been investigated for the treatment of PSC in an attempt to delay disease progression. Immunosupressants, corticosteroids, antifibrogenic agents, endoscopic management and limited surgical management are used with limited success. Liver transplantation is the only form of therapy that positively affects survival and up to 80% of patient\u2019s will experience significant quality of life improvement after liver transplant.",

It is characterized in this patient by its presence in both cerebral hemispheres.\n\nThe two most common presenting symptoms are headache and seizure.  Hemiparesis was the most common neurologic deficit at presentation occurring in up to 83% of patients.  This patient denied headaches, but did have seizures and hemiparesis.  The imaging finding of ring-enhancing lesions is not specific enough to be diagnostic.  Ultimately, a biopsy of the lesions was required for definitive diagnosis.CT or MRI can be used to image patients with suspected brain lesions.  However, MRI is more sensitive and CT can miss lesions in the posterior fossa.  In a small study looking at imaging in patients with multifocal glioblastoma multiforme, it was found that the lesions were always hypointense or isodense on CT and hyperintense on T-2 weighted MRI.

            "Disease Discussion": "Adenomyosis is a common, benign gynecologic disorder of premenopausal, multiparous women usually greater than 30 years old.  It frequently co-exists with other pelvic diseases.  It represents focal or diffuse invasion of the basal endometrium into the myometrium causing a reactive hyperplasia amidst small foci of entrapped glandular elements and hemorrhage.   Basal endometria is not responsive to menstrual cycle hormonal fluctuations and thus the thickness of the endometrial layer does not vary with the menstrual cycle.  The disease is sometimes referred to as \u201cendometriosis interna\u201d.\n\nWomen with adenomysis present with the nonspecific symptoms of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.   The prevalence of the disease is 8.8 \u2013 30% and is found in about 30% of hysterectomy specimens.  Between 60 \u2013 80% of patients have other pelvic disorders such as leiomyoma (35-55%) and endometriosis (36-40%).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasound are the best modalities with which to study adenomyosis.  MRI has the advantage of better contrast resolution, larger field of view and superior sensitivity (88 \u2013 93%) and specificity (66 \u2013 91), but at a substantially greater financial cost.   The MR image will show loss of the normal uterine junctional zone.  It is instead expanded and replaced with focal or diffuse low T1 and T2 tissue signal, the thickness of which correlates well with the severity of adenomyosis.  A junctional zone thickness of between 10 \u2013 12 mm is a commonly accepted criterion for diagnosis.  A requirement for greater thickness provides increased specificity.  The low T2 signal is due to the proliferation of reactive smooth muscle elements in response to the endometrial invasion and a generally decreased vascularity of these areas.  Linear striations of high T2 signal radiating from the endometrium are specific for adenomyosis.  One may also see small foci of increased T2 signal.  These are thought to represent small endometrial cysts, hemorrhage or endometrial tissue.  This finding adds specificity to the imaging study.\n\nContrast enhanced sequences are not typically necessary.  T1 weighted sequences may be helpful in identifying small hemorrhagic foci but otherwise add little to the study",

Bicornuate uterus (class IV) is characterized by 2 uterine horns but one cervix and vagina.  It is caused by incomplete resorption of the uterine septum.  However, the septum is composed of myometrium and often doesn't extend the entire length of the uterine cavity.  These features distinguish it from a septate uterus in which there is a fibrous septum. These patients are typically asymptomatic and no treatment is typically necessary.  Most of these women maintain their fertility.  However, there is an association between bicornuate uterus and incompetent cervix.  Class V and VI are septate uterus (high incidence of infertility) and T-shaped uterus (results from diethylstilbestrol exposure inutero), respectively.\n\nHysterosalpingography is often used to evaluate the uterine cavity, while US is the typical screening exam for uterine wall abnormalities.

The lesions are surrounded by a well defined sclerotic border with benign-appearing periosteal reaction and mild soft tissue swelling medially. The metaphyseal lesions extend across the physis into the epiphysis. There are no fracture lucencies and the joint spaces are maintained.

            "Discussion": "In the 1830\u2019s, Sir Benjamin Collins Brodie recognized a chronic inflammatory process in the tibia with no acute symptoms or known precipitating infection. This rare lesion, known today as a Brodie\u2019s abscess, is a localized type of subacute or chronic pyogenic osteomyelitis. Pathogenesis is due to an insidious bacteremia with septic emboli to a normal or minimally traumatized long bone, often from an infection with Staphylococcus aureus. The lesion is predominant in young males with unfused epiphyseal plates, typically presenting during the second decade of life. Brodie\u2019s abscess is described as a small, eccentric, localized, lytic lesion with surrounding reactive sclerosis. It is characteristically found in the metaphyseal region of long bones of the lower extremity, most commonly in the tibia. The usual presenting complaint is recurrent pain and localized swelling; systemic symptoms are typically absent.\n\nRadiographs of a Brodie\u2019s abscess often demonstrate a localized area of radiolucency with surrounding sclerosis. The lucent region is commonly located in the metaphysis where it may extend to the growth plate by a tortuous channel.  Detection of this focal metaphyseal abscess with involvement of the growth plate is diagnostic for osteomyelitis. Conventional radiographs should be the initial imaging study for evaluating osteomyelitis although, in early osteomyelitis they are usually normal or may show soft tissue swelling or benign periosteal reaction.\n\nBone scans are more sensitive than conventional x-rays for the early detection of osteomyelitis although not as sensitive as MR imaging.  A focal area of radiopharmaceutical uptake at the site of suspected infection would suggest a Brodie\u2019s abscess. Both Brodie\u2019s abscesses and eosinophilic granulomas show radiopharmaceutical uptake and therefore this cannot be used as a distinguishing feature.\n\nMagnetic resonance (MR) imaging provides a greater accuracy in delineating the extent of disease, a more rapid evaluation. Furthermore, MR imaging possesses a high sensitivity in the detection of bone infection. On T1-weighted MR images, subacute osteomyelitis with Brodie\u2019s abscess presents as a low-intensity signal mass with low-signal-intensity rim that becomes a high-intensity signal mass with a thick, low-intensity rim on T2 weighted MR images. The abscess may rarely extend into the cortex and into soft tissues. In addition, the infection may rarely traverse the open growth plate, to involve the epiphysis. Other findings of chronic osteomyelitis include cortical bone thickening, sequestra, sinus tracts to the adjacent soft tissues. Post-contrast MR images show a non-enhancing mass with enhancing periphery.\n\nOn the imaging studies, our patient showed findings consistent with a Brodie\u2019s abscess with additional more unusual findings of extension across the growth plate into the epiphysis and cortical invasion into adjacent soft tissues. Alternate diagnoses in the differential can be excluded by the absence of a lesion 15 months prior to detection in this skeletally immature youth. Histopathologic confirmation with and positive cultures for Staphylococcus aureus, however, provide definitive diagnosis of a Brodie\u2019s abscess.\n\nTreatment for Brodie\u2019s abscess includes surgical debridement and antibiotic therapy. A sterile abscess may be treated without antibiotics only if there is symptomatic improvement and radiographic regression of the lesion. More aggressive treatment, such debridement followed by bone grafting, may be needed for abscesses that form slightly before or after bone maturation and do not resolve with surgical treatment."

            "Disease Discussion": "Osteomyelitis may result from open injury to bone and surrounding soft tissue, from hematogenous and local spread from adjacent tissues and as a postoperative complication(1). The specific organism isolated in bacterial osteomyelitis is often associated with the age of the patient or a common clinical scenario (i. e., trauma or recent surgery). Staphylococcus aureus is implicated in most patients with acute hematogenous osteomyelitis. Staphylococcus epidermidis, S. aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated in patients with chronic osteomyelitis. \n\nTreatment generally involves clinical evaluation, imaging evaluation for disease extent, laboratory determination of microbial etiology and susceptibilities, antimicrobial therapy and, if necessary, debridement, dead-space management and stabilization of bone.  Localized bone pain, erythema and drainage around the affected area may be present. The cardinal signs of subacute and chronic osteomyelitis include draining sinus tracts, deformity, instability and local signs of impaired vascularity, range of motion and neurologic status. \n\nWhen there is clinical suspicion for osteomyelitis after physical examination and history, baseline radiographs should be performed followed by magnetic resonance imaging when available to define the extent of osteomyelitis and cellulitis. When MRI is not available, bone scans are useful for determining the extent of the infection. Laboratory tests may show leukocytosis (especially in the acute presentation) and elevations in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level may be noted. Blood cultures are positive in as high as one-half of children with acute osteomyelitis. \n\nIn acute osteomyelitis, the radiographs may be negative or may show only soft tissue swelling and periosteal reaction. Evidence of medullary destruction may not appear until approximately two weeks after the onset of infection. Positive radiographic findings, when present include osteolysis, periosteal reaction and sequestra (segments of necrotic bone separated from living bone by granulation tissue). \n\nA bone abscess found during the subacute or chronic stage of hematogenous osteomyelitis is known as a Brodie's abscess.  Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive test for evaluating osteomyelitis and the areas of osteomyelitis and cellulitis show high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images enhancement on postcontrast T1-weighted MR images.",

Partial rupture may not have a well-defined onset and may involve gradual worsening of symptoms.   The degree of rupture is defined as follows:Tendon Grading SystemGrade 1: Minimal Disruption; Grade 2: Greater than 50% Fiber Disruption; Grade 3: Complete Tear. With partial ruptures, the clinical picture may not be as clear, the and imaging can play a crucial role.  A complete tear shows discontinuity of fibers while a partial tear shows tendon thickening and increased signal on T2-weighted images. The patient described above has pain over 2 months with no specific inciting event. Treatment was immobilization.

His vestibular symptoms were transient in nature.\n\nOther CPA masses such as eidermoid includion cysts (IEC's) that don't enhance, Lipomas (T1 doesn't show fat), and Hemangiomas (hyperintense on T1 and T2, often with flow voids present as well) though in the original differential were not in the final differential as the enhancement characteristics of the MRI (as well as morphology) was essentially able to eliminate them from further consideration.  Though the mass looked morphologically like a schwannoma, there still was the possibility, though very slight, that it could be a meningioma as enhancement characteristics can be similar between meningiomas and schwannomas.  \n\nThe pathological sample however, confirmed the very strong suspicion that it was a schwannoma."

            "Title": "Vestibular (Acoustic) Schwannoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Vestibular schwannomas, also known as acoustic Schwannomas, acoustic neuromas, acoustic neurinomas, and vestibular neurilemomas are benign neoplasms derived from Schwann cells encompassing the vestibular (as opposed to cochlear) portion of CN VIII.  They are the most common cerebropontine angle (CPA) mass, making up approximately 80% of all CPA tumors and approximately 8% of all intracranial tumors in adults.\n\nPatients with vestibular schwannomas typically present between 30-50 years of age with the overall incidence of symptomatic vestibular schwannomas at 1/100,000 person-years, though asymptomatic lesions may be more common.  Most lesions are unilateral.  However, as many as 10% of patients with vestibular schwannomas have Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) with more than 75% of affected NF2 patients having bilateral vestibular schwannomas. \n\nMost patients present with complaints of hearing loss and/or tinnitus.  Many also complain of difficulties with balance/and or gait.  In a case series of 1000 acoustic Schwannomas, at time of diagnosis, 95% of patients had cochlear nerve symptoms, 61% had vestibular symptoms, 9% had trigeminal symptoms (most often sensory) and 6% had facial nerve complaints.  (Note that more patients had trigeminal symptoms than facial nerve symptoms, despite the close proximity of CN VII to CN VIII!)  \n\nAs most patients do have hearing loss from the affected nerve, audiometry is the most sensitive initial clinical screening test for a vestibular schwannoma.  However, HRCT or MRI (MRI with gadolinium contrast being preferable to HRCT) is needed for more definitive diagnosis.      \n   \nAcoustic schwannomas typically originate at the entrance of the internal auditory canal (IAC) and extend out into the CPA, resembling an \u201cice-cream cone,\u201d often causing mass affect on other structures as they enlarge.  This origin and appearance, evident with MRI and/or HRCT, helps distinguish them from other CPA masses such as meningiomas (the 2nd most common CPA mass), epidermoid inclusion cysts (EIC\u2019s, 3d most common CPA mass), lipomas, angiomas, arachnoid cysts, mets, etc.  \n\nIn addition to the morphology and location/origin of vestibular schwannomas, they also have enhancing characteristics that aid in distinguishing them from other CPA masses.  On T1-weighted images, schwannomas are hypointense compared to surrounding brain parenchyma, and enhance markedly with IV gadolinium.  T2-weighted images show hyperintense signal.  \n\nMeningiomas are typically isointense rather than hypointense on T1 but may be hyperintense with T2 imaging and also enhance brightly with gadolinium.  With the enhancement however, meningiomas are often more homogeneous in appearance than the more heterogeneous Schwannomas that is sometimes due to benign cystic degeneration.  Similar to Schwannomas, EIC\u2019s are hypointense with T1 images and are hyperintense with T2.  However, EIC\u2019s don\u2019t enhance with gadolinium (other than occasionally a thin ring of enhancement around their periphery).\n\nWhen observation is not appropriate, treatment of vestibular schwannomas is usually surgical, though radiation therapy (stereotactic or \"Gamma Knife\" is also being used with success.  Chemotherapy has not been proven beneficial.",

            "Title": "Fronto-nasal encephalocele",
            "Disease Discussion": "The term cephalocele refers to a defect in the skull and dura with extracranial extension of intracranial structures.  The term encephalocele refers to herniation of both brain tissue and meninges through the skull defect, whereas the term meningocele refers to herniation of the meninges only.  Both the skull defect and herniation are more common in the midline.  \n\nMost encephaloceles are easily recognized by the clinician.  On initial examination, the patient has a large midline extracranial mass that is soft to palpation.  In patients with obvious masses such as these, the imaging study is obtained to look for associated brain anomalies that may alter the child's prognosis.  An example of such an associated anomaly is shown in Films .3 - .6.  This patient with a large frontal encephalocele also has agenesis of the corpus callosum and multiple gray matter heterotopias in the subependymal region.  The absence of the corpus callosum can be detected on both the sagittal images by the absence of the corpus on the midline image and on the axial images by the characteristic shape of the frontal horns and the parallel lateral ventricles.\n\nAnother reason to obtain imaging studies in patients with encephaloceles is to look for the location of the major vascular structures of the brain.  Particularly, because most encephaloceles are in the midline, the torcula and the superior sagittal sinus are crucial structures that must be located.  In Films .7 - .9, a parietal encephalocele is shown.  This case has two very important findings.  The first is the deformity of the brain in the region of the encephalocele.  Notice how the midbrain and cerebellum are stretched toward the calvarial defect.  This stretching results from the pulsations of the brain causing it to be pushed out of the calvarial defect.  The immature brain (before myelination) is very soft and easily deformed.  Therefore it can be molded into just about any shape.  It is common to see this sort of stretching of brain toward the skull defect in patients with encephaloceles.  The other important feature of this case is the position of the superior sagittal sinus.  On sequential coronal films, going from front to back, the sagittal sinus can be visualized in its entirety in relation to the encephalocele.  Arrows point to the sinus as it courses within the most inferior and lateral aspect of the sac on the right.  Notice that the sinus would be outside of the calvarium if the calvarium were present.  More posteriorly, the torcula is high and the straight sinuses are seen to course steeply inferiorly within the walls of the tentorium cerebellum (arrows).  The steep leaves of the tentorium probably result from the same process that causes herniation of the midbrain and cerebellum into the calvarial defect.  \n\nSpecial mention should be made of sphenoidal and fronto-nasal encephaloceles because they are often clinically occult at birth.  A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis of encephalocele in adolescents and young adults who present with nasal or nasopharyngeal masses.",

            "Title": "Endometrioma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Endometriomas are caused by endometriosis which is endometrial tissue present outside of the uterine cavity.  Typical locations include on the ovaries (76%), anterior and posterior cul-de-sac (69%), posterior broad ligament (47%), uterosacral ligament (36%), uterus (11%), colon (4%) and small bowel (0.5%). Women of childbearing age are affected and the mean age of diagnosis is 25-29. The overall prevalence of endometriosis in woman is estimated to be 5-10%. Clinical manifestations include dysmenorrhea, dyspareunia, abdominal pain, dysfunctional uterine bleeding and infertility.  Small implants and adhesions are not well evaluated radiologically; therefore, laparoscopy remains the standard of reference for diagnosis and staging.  \n\nAn endometrioma may be defined as an area of endometriosis, usually in the ovary, that has enlarged sufficiently to be classified as a tumor or cyst.  It develops secondary to a deep endometriotic implant that undergoes repeated hemorrhage. It can completely replace normal ovarian tissue.  If large enough to see by ultrasound the mass typically has homogenous low-level echoes -- a non-specific appearance which can also be seen with entities such as hemorrhagic cysts and malignancy. A recent study (Patel et al) noted that 95% of endometriomas in their study exhibited this typical appearance on ultrasound. Although endometriomas frequently contain septations, the absence of wall nodularity and presence of diffuse low level echoes favors endometrioma over malignancy.  The appearance of endometriomas can mimic neoplasm including wall thickening, septations, wall nodularity and echogenic wall foci.   Detection of endometriosis implants and adhesions by ultrasound is not practical due to their small size and large variety of appearances.   Differential diagnosis includes hemorrhagic cysts, dermoid cysts and cystic neoplasms.   Resolution of a cystic lesion on a follow-up ultrasound effectively rules out endometrioma.  Because of the wide variability of ultrasound appearance of endometriomas pelvic MRI can be very helpful. \n\nThe appearance of endometriomas on MRI is more specific than other non-invasive imaging methods.  Imaging planes can include all three standard projections (axial, sagittal, and coronal), with the sagittal plane being particularly useful for evaluating the cul-de-sac and rectum. Endometriomas appear hyperintense on T1-weighted images.  On T2 weighted images they display heterogenous \u201cshading\u201d or loss of signal intensity compared with T1 weighted images which is due to the chronic cyclical nature of its blood products and helps differentiate it from other lesions with more acute hemorrhage. The findings on T2 weighted sequence are variable and depend on the concentration of blood products.   Fat suppression increases the conspicuity of endometriomas and allows more detailed evaluation of their architecture.  This is especially helpful in differentiating endometriomas from fat-containing lesions such as dermoid cysts.  Gadolinium iv contrast enhancement is not particularly useful for differentiating endometriomas from other lesions as endometriomas have non-specific variable enhancement. Dermoids can be recognized and differentiated from endometriomas by the presence of chemical shift artifact and signal drop-out on the fat-suppression images. Mucinous lesions can have increased signal intensity on T1-weighted but their signal is considerably less intense than that of fat or blood.  Hemorrhagic cysts can have similar T1 characteristics, but will not demonstrate T2 \u201cshading\u201d and can be differentiated from endometriomas when they resolve over time.  Visualization of solid components, septations, and a size larger than expected for an endometrioma are features suggestive of malignancy.",

They are the most common primary intracranial neoplasm and have the worst prognosis. They are typically seen in adults greater than 40 with lower grade astrocytomas occurring more often in younger adults and children. They present most commonly with headaches or seizures, but can also present with hemiparesis or signs of increased intracranial pressure. These symptoms usually present in a short time frame, on the order of weeks to months. \n\nRadiologically, they are usually show a heterogeneous signal on MR and commonly have extensive surrounding \"vasogenic edema\". Tumor necrosis is a hallmark of GBM and typically appears on MRI as an area of non-enhancing T-1 hypointensity. This area is frequently surrounded by an enhancing region. Invasion of white matter tracts is common with spread of the neoplasm to the opposite hemisphere through the corpus callosum in up to 75% of cases.  The regions of \"vasogenic edema\" usually include white-matter that is infiltrated by neoplastic cells.  Neoplastic infiltration often extends beyond any region of signal abnormality noted on imaging, and even into areas that are \"normal\" by both gross and microscopic pathology. \n\nRadiological features generally correlate with tumor grade but are not specific. Histological grading is the most reliable means of assessing this neoplasm. \n\nhttp://www.nabtt.org/overview.htm",

The condition can be manifested shortly after birth, or it can remain asymptomatic for the life of the individual and be found subsequently on postmortem exam.  Due to this large variation in presentation, this defect presents itself along a wide spectrum, making it difficult to diagnose unless imaging of the brain is preformed.  \n\n\tOccurrence of corpus callosal defects is said to occur in roughly 0.7-5.3% of the US population, with a suggested similar worldwide occurrence .  The condition is noted to be hereditary in some cases, being passed down either as an X-linked recessive or autosomal dominant depending on the associated disease.  It has also been known to occur often with one of the many different trisomies, most often to include 8, 13, 18, and 21 .  Conditions which often coincide with this defect include Chiari II malformations, encephalocele, schizencephaly, lissencephaly, and many syndromes such as Aicardi\u2019s, CRASH and fetal alcohol syndrome.\n\t\n\tThe congenital form of callosal agenesis usually occurs due to a defect in embryological development during the 7-20th gestational week .  Normal development of the corpus callosum begins with formation from the commissural plate of the telencephalon .  The genu and the body are formed first, followed in time by the development of the rostrum and splenium. From this, white matter axons develop which form projections into the bilateral cerebral cortices. An embryological defect in any of the stages can cause either complete or partial agenesis of the callosum, if occurring later in development a defect in the posterior section is generally observed.  Finally, if the genu and body are dysgenic, one can assume that a secondary cause is manifesting such as infection or hemorrhage due to the embryologic sequence of formation previously mentioned. \n\n\tPresentation usually occurs secondary to an associated congenital defect, mental retardation, seizures, or as an incidental finding on an MRI.  Diagnosis is best performed by MRI, which demonstrates much finer detail of the lesion and any surrounding neuronal disturbances.  Findings often noted in addition to an agenic/dysgenic corpus callosum include a high riding third ventricle, enlarged occipital horns of the lateral ventricles (colpocephaly), longitudinal straightening of the lateral ventricles, and parallel white matter bands along the midline where the corpus would normally develop termed \u201cProbst bundles.\u201d In addition, the absence of the cingulate gyrus results in the sulci of the inner aspect of the cerebrum to be found to radiate outwards from the third ventricle instead of their normal appearance surrounding the corpus. Imaging is usually performed by midline sagittal MRI in order to fully demonstrate the extent of callosal dysgenesis, coronal views to best visualize Probst bundles if present, and axial views which  demonstrate colpocephaly.  T1, T2, FLAIR, and proton density enhanced scans can all be used in conjunction with each other to best visualize the anatomy of the lesion and its surrounding parts.\n\nTherapy for this condition depends completely upon the clinical presentation of the disease, along with any associated syndromes. Due to the wide range of presenting factors, some individuals may go their entire life unaware of their lesion, while others may present at birth.  Due to this fact and the varying degree of callosal absence, treatment must be directed at the specific clinical symptoms and not towards the lesion itself.",

Chronic hypernatremia should be corrected slowly due to the risk of brain edema which may lead to brain herniation, permanent neurologic deficits and lysis of myelin. In this case, the time course of the hypernatremia was unknown. Typical presentation is usually neurologic deterioration 48-72 hours after the sodium level has been corrected. Pseudobulbar palsy and spastic quadriplegia are two of the physical findings often associated with the syndrome.

            "Title": "Hemangioblastoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Hemangioblastomas represent approximately 1-2% of all primary brain tumors.  They are strongly associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.  10-20% of hemangioblastomas occur with VHL syndrome and approximately 45% of patients with VHL syndrome eventually develop a hemangioblastoma.  95% of hemangioblastomas occur in the posterior fossa (fewer than 100 case reports exist of supratentorial locations), and overall they account for 7-12% of all posterior fossa tumors in adults (including primary and metastatic tumors). \n\nPathologically, hemangioblastomas are highly vascular tumors comprised primarily of capillaries and pericytes (aka \u201cstromal\u201d cells).  While their World Health Organization classification remains under tumors of uncertain histogenesis, hemangioblastomas may arise from embryonic plexus epithelium based upon their expression of transthyretin and transferrin.  They are typically well circumscribed, with 60% being cystic with a mural nodule and 40% being solid.  Their solid/nodular component is composed of tightly packed blood vessels varying in size from capillaries to cavernous, with the nidus of the tumor abutting the pial surface.  Hemangioblastomas do not have a capsule, and when cystic, their wall is composed of compressed neural glial cells.  The associated cystic fluid is xanthochromic, with a concentration of amino acids, alkaline phosphates, and mucoproteins similar to that of blood, suggesting origination from diffusion from the solid vascular component of the tumor.\n\nHemangioblastomas are rare in children and typically present during the third to fifth decade.  They typically grow slowly and clinical presentation depends upon the tumor size and location.  Posterior fossa tumors can present with minor neurological symptoms for months followed by an acute exacerbation.  The most common symptoms include: headache, vomiting, and ataxia.  A distinguishing clinical presentation of hemangioblastomas is their potential to present with polycythemia secondary to tumoral production of erythropoietin.  This occurs in approximately 20% of posterior fossa tumors, and is more commonly seen in solid hemangioblastomas.  Surgical resection is considered standard of care, however recurrence is seen in approximately 25% of cases, most frequently in association with VHL syndrome.\n\nCT evaluation of hemangioblastomas classically demonstrates a large, low density, cystic-appearing cerebellar mass.  The addition of intravenous contrast material greatly increases the ability to identify a strongly enhancing mural nodule adjacent to the pial surface.  Solid tumors enhance strongly and uniformly.  During angiography, the common pattern is a large avascular posterior fossa mass with a small, highly vascular mural nodule.  A prolonged vascular stain is typical.  MR imaging reveals the cystic component with a low signal on T1-weighted sequences and a high signal on T2-weighted sequences.  The solid/nodular component is variable in its signal characteristics, and typically is heterogeneously isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences.  Intense enhancement following gadolinium is typical.  Prominent serpentine \u201cflow voids\u201d can often be seen as well within the mass.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Thrombosis of the cortical cerebral venous system resulting in stroke is a well known complication of prothrombotic states caused by pregnancy.  Other reasons for this complication include hematological or systemic diseases such as polycythemia, lupus, various malignancies, severe dehydration or certain chemotheraputic agents.  Virtually anything that slows down blood flow or causes direct inflammation can cause this potentially life-threatening complication.  Fortunately, the mortality rate, which was once as high as 10-30% has now decreased to less than 10% because of improved early detection and more adequate therapy.\n\n     The clinical presentation is often vague.  A high index of clinical suspicion is often warranted if one is to make a timely diagnosis.  Early symptoms can start off with headache that then progresses to focal neurological deficits.  Reports of lethargy, confusion, nausea, drowsiness, nystagmus and hearing loss complicate the neurological exam.  A high degree of clinical suspicion is helpful if evaluating an at risk population. Too often the thrombosis develops well before the symptoms manifest themselves and the symptoms are the result of the affected territories.  \n\n     The diffusion findings in human cerebral venous infarction are controversial though most recent studies describe high signal intensity on diffusion images that correspond to low signal intensity on ADC images.   These signal findings have been attributed to cytotoxic edema.  In direct contrast, some studies showed decreased to no increase in signal on diffusion images and increased to slightly decreased signal on ADC map.  It is believed these findings represent early vasogenic edema perhaps in combination with early cytotoxic edema.  The truth is likely to represent spectrum signal variation in both diffusion and ADC images that evolves over the course of the pathologic insult.  \n     \n     Treatment of this condition often involves heparin and/or coumadin depending on the current condition of the patient and pregnancy status.  In some patients who continue to deteriorate, aggressive micro catheter directed dural venous sinus thrombolysis with urokinase or other thrombolytic agents has shown clinical benefit.  The use of mechanical thrombolysis is usually reserved for patients who have poor response to local infusions of urokinase and rapid neurological decline and/or contraindications to thrombolytics.",

            "Title": "Fibrous dysplasia",
            "Disease Discussion": "The name fibrous dysplasia was coined by Lichtenstein in 1938 to describe a disorder of expanding fibro-osseous lesions that had been referred to as fibrous osteodystrophy, osteodystrophia fibrosa and osteitis fibrosa disseminata.  Its etiology is unknown; however, the most widely accepted theory is that it is a developmental abnormality of mesenchyme in which osteoblasts fail to undergo normal morphologic differentiation and maturation.  The medullary cavity is filled with fibrous tissue in which trabeculae of poorly calcified primitive new bone are developed by osseous metaplasia.  Both sexes are equally affected.  It begins early in life, often in infancy, but being frequently asymptomatic it usually remains unrecognized until adulthood.\n\nFibrous dysplasia is not hereditary, and it may involve one or many bones.  The polyostotic variety and rarely the monostotic type when associated with endocrine dysfunction, typically manifested by precocious female sexual development and cutaneous pigmentation, is known as the McCune-Albright syndrome.\n\nFibrous dysplasia may be associated with either solitary or multiple lesions, in one or more bones.  Approximately 70-80% of cases are monostotic, 20-30% are polyostotic, and 2-3% are associated with endocrinopathies.  Abnormal cutaneous pigmentation, which is the most common extraskeletal manifestation of fibrous dysplasia, is evident in more than half of patients with polyostotic disease and is almost always present in those with both multiple bone lesions and endocrine dysfunction.  However, it is quite infrequently seen with monostotic lesions.  Monostotic fibrous dysplasia is most frequently encountered in a rib, femur, tibia, calvarium and humerus in order of decreasing frequency, however, polyostotic fibrous dysplasia more frequently involves the skull and facial bones, pelvis, spine and shoulder girdle.\n\nInvolvement of the skull and the facial bones is noted in approximately 10-25% of patients with monostotic fibrous dysplasia and in 50% of those with polyostotic involvement.  Common areas of involvement in the skull include the frontal, sphenoid, maxillary and ethmoid bones; the occipital and temporal bones are affected less commonly.\n\nRoutine radiographs commonly reveal single or multiple, symmetric or asymmetric radiolucent or sclerotic lesions in the skull and facial bones or both.  Profound and often extensive sclerosis tends to predominate in the skull and particularly affects its base and the sphenoid wings.\n\nHazy radiolucent lesions which are usually the most common manifestation of fibrous dysplasia are often associated with widened diploic spaces and expansion in the skull and facial bones.  The osseous expansion is focal or widespread and is almost always in an outward direction.  The outer table of the vault is invariably convex, whereas both tables remain essentially intact rather than destroyed as is the case frequently with Paget's disease.  Another manifestation in the cranial vault represents variable sized, localized, relatively radiolucent zones which when surrounded by a sclerotic rim may have a doughnut shape.  Due to the occasional marked hypervascularity of fibrous dysplasia in the skull, spontaneous recurrent hemorrhages do occur and complicate the picture.",

            "Title": "Intramuscular Hemangioma",
            "Disease Discussion": "A hemangioma is an abnormal proliferation of blood vessels that may occur in any vascularized tissue including skin, subcutaneous tissue, viscera, muscle, synovium, and bone, but they do not spread to avascular tissue such as cartilage.  Some believe that hemangiomas are neoplasms while others consider them hamartomas.  Abnormal angiogenesis involving cytokines, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is suspected. They most often occur in the skin or subcutaneous tissues. Visceral hemangiomas are much less common but may result in organ dysfunction. They also occur in deep soft tissues and bones. Other diseases are associated with hemangiomas. Gorham disease is a process of massive osteolysis, which is believed to be within the spectrum of hemangiomatous disease. Hemangiomas occurring with multiple enchondromas exist in Maffucci syndrome.\n\nSkeletal muscle is the most common site for hemangioma of the deep soft tissue. Intramuscular hemangiomas are often asymptomatic or painless and found as an incidental finding.  They may become symptomatic causing pain and swelling.   Intramuscular hemangiomas are most commonly found in young people, virtually equal in males and females. The most common location is the thigh.  The symptoms of pain and swelling due to increased blood flow through the hemangioma are often exacerbated by exercise, which results in vascular dilation. Rarely, large intramuscular hemangiomas may be associated with significant shunting of blood flow even leading to heart murmurs and/or congestive heart failure similar to that of an arteriovenous fistula. \n\nImaging:  Plain film radiography of soft tissue hemangiomas may demonstrate soft tissue density without or with phleboliths.  They may cause benign-appearing periosteal reaction or chronic cortical thickening and remodeling in adjacent bone. Cortical changes may include erosions, thickening, tunneling, and osteopenia. Phleboliths within the soft tissue mass are diagnostic but uncommon. MRI is the imaging modality of choice in concert with plain films. Hemangiomas show increased signal on both T1 and T2 weighted images, frequently with areas of signal void, which may represent fibrous tissue, phleboliths, thrombi or high flow.  These signal characteristics with a serpentine pattern of vessels and interspersed fat are diagnostic. Gadolinium enhancement is also noted.  Features separating hemangiomas from malignant soft tissue tumors include frequency of lobulation, septation, and central low-intensity dots on T2-weighted images. Hemangiomas tend to enhance markedly compared with malignant soft-tissue tumors.  Angiography demonstrates a highly vascular lesion with parallel oriented vessels. \n\nTreatment: The natural course of intramuscular hemangiomas is usually fatty replacement with gradual involution. Therefore, conservative observation is appropriate if symptoms are absent or mild.  If symptoms dictate treatment, embolization may be used to provide symptomatic relief of intramuscular hemangiomas. When surgical excision is required, embolization may be used preoperatively to decrease blood loss and recurrence. Excision can provide permanent relief. However, it is usually restricted to hemangiomas contained within a single muscle.  If complete resection is not possible they nearly always recur. Radiation has been used as a non-surgical therapy.  Chemotherapy has been used for extensive hemangiomatosis.  Steroids have been used for some of the syndromic versions.",

            "Discussion": "The issue of screening high risk patients with breast MR has been discussed for several years.  It has taken some time for vendors to develop the software necessary to accurately and efficiently use existing MR technology for a screening population.  MR utility has been extensively used for problem-solving and for evaluation of the patient with impants. \n\nThe exquisite contrast sensitivity of MR is balanced in the high-risk patient by somewhat decreased specificity; many things other than cancer enhance, but benign entities often have an intrinsic high T2 signal whereas breast cancer does not.\n\nSensitivity has been greatly improved with the use of dynamic contrast-enhancement, and the addition of software tools allowing the creation of a graphical depiction of contrast kinetics within a specified region of interest.  Given that the region is selected appropriately, breast cancer tissue will typically exhibit an early wash-in, and a rapid wash-out of contrast enhancement.  In contradistinction, beningn tissue will demonstrate a progressive increase in enhancement or alternatively a plateau. \n\nSoftware refinements continue to be made in order to hopefully better define the specific region of interest and therefore yield the best curve.\n\nAt the time this case was performed, the combination fo software and hardware technology necessary to perform adequate screening MR had only been available for approximately 2 months.  This patient's cancer was only detectable initially through this modality.  The mammogram was, even retrospectively, negative, and there was no palpable abnormality for which to justify an ultrasound (although the lesion was in fact visible under ultrasound).  This cancer almost certainly would have not been found until it was at a much more advanced state, and this patient's life may have just been saved-- a feat that would have likely not been possible just a few months ago."

            "Title": "Infiltrating ductal carcinoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "The majority of invasive breast cancers are nonspecific forms of carcinoma that orginate in the ductal epithelium, likely in the terminal duct at its juncton with the lobule.  The better differentiated forms of invasive ductal carcinoma create specfic patterns that have been subclassified but the majority of ductal malignancies fall into the general category of undifferentiated cancers.  When a cancer does not fit into any of the defined subtypes it is termed not otherwise specified (NOS).  The relative frequency of these lesion appears to remain fairly constant regardless of age.  In general, infiltrating ductal carcinoma NOS elicits a vigorous desmosplastic response with fibrosis. \n\nSometimes, these cancers are found first by the woman herself.  In general, these are firm lesions that may tether to the skin or the chest wall.  Vascular and lymphatic spread result, and if left untreated, carcinoma may eventually erode through the skin, producing an ulcerated mass.  Dermal lymphatic involvement with tumor can occur early in the course early in the course of the disease, signaling the poor prognosis associated with inflammatory carcinoma.  \n\nPathologist have subclassified infiltrating ductal carcinoma into low-grade (I) fairly uniform cell types that show some differentiation (mucin or tubule) to high grade (III) in which anaplastic, pleomorphic cell predominate.  Collagen production is prominent feature of many breast cancers, and calcium deposition is common within the tumor.  These are responsible for the characteristic firm gritty nature of these malignancies.\n\nThe mammographic appearance of breast cancer is varied.  The diagnosis is high suggestive when an irregular mass with spiculated margins is present.  Lobulated shapes are fairly common, and the more undulating the border, the more suspicious the lesion.  Some ductal cancers reveal their presence early by the deposition of calcium which is due to either direct cellular secretion or cell necrosis.  The fibrosis, desmoplasia and cicatrization that accompany many ductal cancers may produce distortion of surrounding architecture with or without an apparent tumor mass, and this may lead to skin/nipple retraction.  Breast cancer usually produces an ill-defined shadow, but even \u201cgarden variety\u201d infiltrating ductal carcinoma may produce a sharply circumscribed mass that is indistinguishable from a benign lesion.  The generally greater x-ray attenutation relative to its volume often distinguishes the malignant lesion.\n\nSome cancers infiltrate without distorting the normal breast architecture and without calcium deposition.  If the normal parenchymal abutting the tumor is the same radiographic density, the tumor may be undectable by mammography.  Occasionally, the only indication of the presence of cancer nonspecific asymmetric density.\n\nJust as there is spectrum of mammographic presentations, the ultrasound appearance of breast cancer is extremely variable.  The classic description of breast cancer is an irregularly shaped hypoechoic structure that frequently has a triangular anterior margin and attenuates and scatters sound, producing shadowing.  This appearance is characteristic of a spiculated scirrhous lesion.  Cancers are almost always irregular, frequently lobulated and hypoechoic.  Breast cancers tend to be more vertically oriented relative to the skin surface but there are always exceptions.  Ultrasound should be only used to differentiate cystic breast lesions from solid ones and to guide needle positioning for interventional procedure.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The name  of this syndrome comes from the position of bow hunters who turn their heads significantly to one side for shooting and arrow.  Typically, it is the contralateral vertebral artery (VA) that is compressed by the head rotation.  If the compressed VA is dominant, or if the ipsilateral VA is stenosed , the patient may have symptoms of posterior fossa ischemia.\n\nPatients with this syndrome have classic symptoms that correlate with slow or lack of blood flow to the posterior fossa structures that are supplied by the vertebrobasilar arterial system. Patient's often experience pre-syncopal symptoms of dizziness or even syncopal episodes when they turn their head to one of the sides.  This usually occurs when one of the vertebral arteries is occluded or severely stenosed secondary to any of the vascular occlusive diseases or congenitally diminutive caliver.  \n\nBy turning the head towards the side of occluded vertebral artery, a contralateral vertebral artery may get stretched or occluded.  This is a mechanical problem at C1-2 level just distal to the vertebral artery exiting the foramen transversarium. There may be redundant soft tissue or ligaments that press against the artery when there is rotation of the head or stretching of the vessel.\n\nOnce the head is turned, patients start feeling dizzy and may experience syncopy if the head is not promptly returned to a neutral position - where the flow throught the patent vertebral artery is restored.\n\nOnce the proper history has been established to suspect Bow Hunter's syndrome, a diagnostic angiogram could be performed.  This is done in muliple projections and in neutral and with provocative manueuvers, that reproducethe patient's symptoms.  Treatment usually involves releasing the soft tissues around the vertebral artery at C1-2 level.\n\nThe name comes from a head position of bow hunters who turn their heads significantly to one of the sides for shooting.",

            "Title": "Alzheimer disease",
            "Disease Discussion": "1) An MRI of this patient revealed generalized cerebral atrophy with narrowed gyri and widened sulci, suggesting a diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) (Figure 1).  AD, the most common cause of dementia, is a frequent occurrence among the elderly population.  Approximately 4.9 million people over the age of 65 are living with the diagnosis of AD.[1]  The disease provides a great burden to family members and has a wide impact on Medicare spending.  Although many advances have been made in providing clinical, radiographic, and biomarker evidence for AD diagnosis, the disease is only definitively diagnosed by brain biopsy or at autopsy.  \n\nGross pathologic exam of the AD patient at autopsy reveals diffuse cerebral atrophy (Figure 2), most prominently in the medial temporal lobes.  Histological exam reveals senile plaques composed of an amyloid \u03b2 (A\u03b2) core (Figure 3).  A\u03b2 is also seen deposited in cerebral vessel walls of AD patients.  Histological evaluation at autopsy additionally reveals neurofibrillary tangles (Figure 4) within the cerebral parenchyma, composed of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.[2]\n\nAD is also associated with degeneration in the basal forebrain and a resulting loss of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine.  This loss of acetylcholine is closely related to memory deficits.[3]  As such, the major class of pharmacologic therapy for AD focuses on inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase such as donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine.  While some relief from AD symptoms is seen with the use of this class of medication, the long-term progression of the disease does not appear to be altered.\n\nPatients with AD have been distinguished from age-matched controls by a significant bilateral reduction in blood flow or metabolism in the temporoparietal cortex using functional neuroimaging.[4]  Additionally, perfusion and diffusion-weighted MR imaging illustrate a bilateral reduction in perfusion in the sensorimotor regions in patients with AD.[4]  The radiographic evidence of hypoperfusion in these regions is consistent with the clinical presentation of AD, namely impairment of recent memory formation, language deficits, and difficulty executing previously learned motor processes.\n\nVarious radiographic measurement techniques have been attempted for relative certainty in early diagnosis of AD.   Bastos-Leite et al identified that hippocampal atrophy could be measured by T1-weighted MR imaging of hippocampal sulcus width.[5]  Furthermore, gross pathologic examination of patients with AD reveals significant bilateral atrophy of the cerebral parenchyma with widened sulci, most notably in the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes.\n\nAtrophy in the frontal and temporal lobe pars orbitalis is suggestive of Pick disease (PD).[6]  PD and AD may present clinically with similar features.  PD typically presents with personality changes and frontotemporal lobe atrophy, and is characterized by greater atrophy of the anterior brain than is seen in AD.[6]  A well-circumscribed lesion with a mass effect on noncontrast CT would indicate a hemorrhage or hematoma.  Multiple oval lesions seen on MRI are found in multiple sclerosis and are frequently found in the periventricular white matter.[7]  Structural changes in the substantia nigra pars compacta are characteristic of Parkinson disease.  Parkinson disease structural changes can be detected through MR imaging while positron emission tomography can be used to measure dopa uptake into the striatum.[8]\n\n2.  Central to the degeneration seen in AD is an accumulation of A\u03b2 peptides, derived from amyloid \u03b2 precursor protein (A?PP).[9]  These peptides have been found deposited throughout the extracellular space of AD plaques and have thus been used as an important pathological marker for AD.[9]  While a correlation between A? and AD has been identified, A? is not strictly localized to the central nervous system and is seen in many other organs including lung, liver, heart, and spleen.[9]  The accumulation of A? in cerebral parenchyma has been shown to be neurotoxic [10,11] and likely contributes to spectrum of clinical features observed in AD.\n\nLewy bodies are aggregates of \u03b1-synuclein most commonly found in Parkinson disease.  Astroglia are supportive cells of the central nervous system and an abundance of these cells would be associated with an astrocytoma.  Sphingolipid accumulation is seen in Niemann-Pick disease.  N-acetyl aspartate is used as a marker of neurons and a decrease is associated with neurodegenerative disorders such as AD.\n\n3.  Apolipoprotein E (APOE) is a protein that is involved in the metabolism of cholesterol and is synthesized by astrocytes.  The gene is located on chromosome 19 and is thought to play a role in the repair of injured nerves.[12]  Of the four APOE alleles, the one with the closest association to AD is \u03b54.  Many studies have suggested a correlation between APOE \u03b54 and AD memory impairment, most significantly in older adults.[12]  APOE encodes a protein that, within the extracellular space, binds cholesterol and becomes incorporated into myelin and cell membranes.  As such, this protein is believed to be involved in the generation of neural synapses.[12]\n\nSynaptic degradation resulting from the mutated apoE \u03b54 allele and defective synaptogenesis may play a role in the atrophy of the corpus collosum in AD.[13]  The degeneration of the corpus collosum and cingulate gyrus in AD is reflected in the apparent deficits in intrahemispheric connection.[13]  The role of an APOE \u03b54 mutation has been associated with AD as a significant risk factor for developing sporadic AD as well as earlier age of onset of the disease.  Although these associations have been established, the role of APOE \u03b54 as a biomarker is still in question as not all patients with the \u03b54 allele develop AD.  Similarly, patients lacking the \u03b54 allele are not excluded from developing sporadic AD.[14]\n\nA mutation in the sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase 1 (SMPD1) gene is seen in Niemann-Pick disease.  The superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene is associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.  Kinesin family member 1B (KIF1B) mutations have been linked to the peripheral nerve disorder Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.  \u03b2-Hexosaminidase A, \u03b1 subunit (HEXA) mutations are seen in association with Tay-Sachs disease.\n\n4.  Patients suffering from AD exhibit pathological changes in the brain including a diffuse loss of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus.[15]  This neurological degradation leads to clinical memory loss and dementia.  The hippocampus functions in memory formation and a loss of neurons leads to difficulty forming new memories.  The loss of neurons in these regions correlates to the pathologic and neuroradiological findings of cerebral atrophy.  As noted above, cerebral atrophy is prominent in the brain of a patient with AD at autopsy, particularly in the medial temporal lobes.[5]  Loss of neurons in alternate brain regions, including hypothalamus, cerebellum, and mammillary bodies are not associated with AD pathology. \n\n5.  The major histological diagnostic findings at autopsy of a patient with AD are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Two cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, A\u03b2 and tau, have been validated in association with AD and can be used to distinguish AD from other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson disease.[16]  An elevation in neurotoxic A\u03b2 leads to the deposition of A\u03b2 plaques in the cerebral parenchyma (leading to the accumulation of senile plaques) as well as in the walls of cerebral blood vessels.[2]  The neurofibrillary tangle (Figure 3), another pathologic finding in AD, consists of an aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins.[2]\n\nAmyloid precursor protein is normally cleaved by \u03b1-secretase to yield multiple fragments that are chiefly eliminated from the brain.  Abnormal cleavage results from a mutation in the amyloid precursor protein, resulting in cleavage by both \u03b2-secretase and \u03b3-secretase, leading to aggregations of abnormally cleaved A\u03b2 with other proteins such as tau, apoE, and presenilin 1 and 2.  These aggregates form the basis for senile plaques (Figure 3) in AD pathology.[17]\n\nAmyloid association with AD has been further established through the exploration of early AD development in adults with Down syndrome.  Down syndrome (trisomy 21) patients living into adulthood have been found to develop senile plaques with A\u03b2 and neurofibrillary tangles in the cerebral cortex at a significantly younger age than individuals without Down syndrome.  The findings of early development of plaques and tangles in association with a duplicate chromosome 21 lead to further linkage studies that proposed an association between the chromosome and AD pathology.  These studies found that mutations in a region of the 21st chromosome, near the gene encoding \u03b2-amyloid and duplicated in trisomy 21, have been associated with familial early-onset AD.[17]\n\nThe presence of biomarkers in the CSF other than amyloid \u03b2 and tau have not been found in association with AD.  Cystatin C is more closely associated with renal function than with neurodegeneration.  \u03b1-synuclein is related to Lewy bodies found in patients with Parkinson disease and not a known AD biomarker.  Fibrillin-1 is a gene associated with the connective tissue disorder Marfan syndrome.  Secreted amyloid precursor protein alpha (sAPP-\u03b1) is related to the response of microglia to chronic inflammation and found in AD, yet has not been established as a significant biomarker.[18]",

            "Disease Discussion": "\u2022  Lesions/Condition:  Osteochondroma\n\nTumor Growth:  Lesions grow by enchondral ossification of proliferating cartilage cells in its cap.  The tumor will continue to enlarge during skeletal growth, but typically becomes latent at skeletal maturity.  \n\n\u2022  Synonyms:  Osteocartilaginous Exostosis\n\n\u2022  Common  Locations:  The most common site of origin for an osteochondroma is the metaphysis at bony sites of tendon and ligamentous attachments.  Common sites include distal femur, proximal humerus, proximal tibia but also may occur less frequently in the pelvis, scapula, spine or any bone preformed in cartilage.\n\n\u2022  Demographics:  Typically occur in first to third decades with prevalence greater in males than in females.  It is the most common skeletal tumor in children with an occurrence of 1 in 200.   They may be solitary or multiple and they may arise spontaneously.\n\n\u2022  Gross  Morphology:  Osteochondromas vary in size.  The average lesion arising from tubular bones is approximately 4cm.  Osteochondromas arising from flat bones tend to be larger with a higher likelihood of malignant transformation.\n\n\u2022  Histology:  Pathologic sections show osteochondromas to have a cartilaginous cap.  Histologically, the cartilaginous cap is identical to the physeal growth plate.  During active growth, the cap is composed of hyaline cartilage.  The thickness of the cap is correlated with the age of the patient, and the cap decreases in size as patient\u2019s age.    In children and adolescents, the cap may be as thick as 3cm, whereas in older patients, it may be thin.  A thick cartilaginous cap (>1cm) in an adult should raise the possibility of malignant transformation (usually chondrosarcomas)\n\n\u2022  Radiology:  Plain radiographic appearances of an osteochondroma are those of a pedunculated or sessile bony excrescence with well-defined margins.  In adults, the cartilage cap often contains flecks of calcification. Continuity of the osteochondroma with the medullary canal is a characteristic finding,  particularly obvious in long bones.   MR imaging is able to detect continuity of the cortical and medullary bone in the outgrowth with that of the parent bone.  This finding is diagnostic of an osteochondroma.  Of greatest utility in the functionality of the MR is the ability to precisely identify and measure the cartilaginous cap of an osteochondroma using T2 weighted spin echo images.  These measurements can be used to supply information regarding the likelihood of malignant changes.\n\n\u2022  Prognosis  and  Treatment:  Most solitary osteochondromas are discovered in children and adolescents  and are painless, slow-growing masses and require no treatment.  Significant symptoms may occur as a result of complications such as fracture, bony deformity, mechanical joint problems, and vascular or neurologic compromise.  Appreciable morbidity is related to resection of osteochondromas and corrective surgery on the osseous deformity.  Resections are typically only performed on mature bone due to the risk of damage to the epiphyseal growth plate resulting in severe growth deformity in the affected bone.  Serial radiographs are performed to monitor for malignant transformation which is estimated at 1% for solitary osteochondromas.  The most common resulting malignant tumor is a chondrosarcoma.",

            "Title": "Arteriovenous Malformation",
            "Disease Discussion": "Arteriovenous Malformation:\nArteriovenous malformations consist of feeding arteries that are dilated with a cluster of entangled vascular loops.  Blood flows preferentially through the AVM therefore depriving other areas of the brain of blood flow.  This steal phenomenon can produce neurological symptoms, seizures, and parenchymal loss.  This increase in blood flow also can produce aneurysms.  The location of the AVMs is 80-85% in the cerebral hemispheres and 10-15% in the posterior fossa.\n\nClinical Presentation:\nArteriovenous malformations are usually congenital developmental anomalies, but are frequently asymptomatic until 30 to 40 years of age.  Approximately 25% of these patients hemorrhage by age 15 and 80-90% of the patients are symptomatic by age 50.  Symptoms include seizure and headaches.\n\nPathology:\nArteriovenous malformations consist of feeding arteries that are dilated with a cluster of entangled vascular loops.  Blood flows preferentially through the AVM therefore depriving other areas of the brain of blood flow.  This steal phenomenon can produce neurological symptoms, seizures, and parenchymal loss.  This increase in blood flow also can produce aneurysms.  The location of the AVMs is 80-85% in the cerebral hemispheres and 10-15% in the posterior fossa.  \n\nImage Findings:\nCT scans typically show tangled vessels in the parenchyma that are high density contrast.  These vessels are noted to have a serpentine configuration.  Curvilinear or speckled calcification may also be present.  MR scans show curvilinear flow voids secondary to fast flow seen on pulse sequences and dilated feeding arteries.  The appearance of the arteries vary due to flow rate, direction, pulse sequence, and the presence and age of the hemorrhage.  Gliosis and hemorrhages also appear on the MR images.  Often MRA images are used to diagnose the disease.  MR is more sensitive to the feeding arteries, the core or nidus, and the enlarged draining veins.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\nDifferential diagnosis includes vascular malformations.  If normal blood flow is present, capillary telangiectasis and developmental venous anomalies are commonly confused with AVM.  Capillary telangiectasis are lesions measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter and are typically found in the pons.  The majority of the lesions do not hemorrhage and are observed as nodular enhancements after contrast on T1WI.  Developmental venous anomalies are the most common cerebral vascular malformation.  These malformations rarely hemorrhage.  If hemorrhage is noted, it is most likely due to a coexisting cavernous angioma.  If the malformation is isolated, they appear to be composed of dilated medullary veins that form a large channel draining into cortical veins or subependymal veins.  If there is high blood flow, AV fistula shares similar characteristics with AVM.  AV fistula is an arterial dissection or laceration that spontaneously communicates with an adjacent vein or dural sinus.  These fistulas are commonly seen in the cavernous sinus, below the petrous temporal bone, and foramen magnum.\n\nTreatment:\nDepending on the size and location of the AVM, the treatment may include embolization, surgery, or radiation therapy.",

            "Title": "Achilles Tendon Rupture",
            "Disease Discussion": "Spontaneous Achilles tendon rupture or partial tears typically occur in otherwise healthy, relatively young patients, with no history of heel or calf pathology.  Most studies find that the majority of individuals who sustain Achilles tendon injury are men in their third to fifth decade of life, who are participating in sports activities.  The injury most commonly occurs secondary to overloading of the musculotendinous unit in a poorly conditioned individual rather than secondary to an underlying tendinopathy.  The mechanical cause of the injury is most commonly active, forceful plantarflexion, usually associated with pushing off athletic movements.  Less commonly, Achilles rupture is caused by violent unexpected dorsiflexion of a plantarflexed foot, such as when a person steps in hole or falls from a height.(1)\n\n     The diagnsosis can often be made by physical examination.  Findings may include a palpable depression over the area of tendon rupture, weakness of plantarflexion, and positive Thompson test.  A positive Thompson test is failure of the foot to plantarflex when the calf muscles are squeezed.(1)\n\n     However, up to 25% of patients with partial or complete Achilles tear may be misdiagnosed based on physical exam findings alone.  Radiographic findings can assist with the diagnsosis.  When the Achilles tendon is ruptured, the sharp posterior contour of Kager's fat pad triangle will become serrated and indistinct.  The Achilles tendon will appear thickened (> 8mm).  Toygar's angle, which is the angle of the posterior skin surface overlying the distal Achilles and posterior calcaneal surfaces will decrease and is considered abnormal if less than 150 degrees. Positive Arner's sign, in which the anterior contour of the Achilles tendon at the insertion curves away from the superior-posterior aspect of the calcaneus, may be positive.(2)\n\n     MR imaging findings may confirm the diagnosis.  Partial Achilles tendon tears demonstrate heterogeneous signal intensity and thickening of the injured tendon without complete interruption.  Edema manifested as increased T2 signal will usually be present within the tendon, subcutaneous tissues, and in Kager's fat pad.  Hemorrhage signal may also be present in those structures and signal characteristics will vary according to the age of the injury.  Complete Achilles rupture manifests as discontinuity of the tendon with fraying and retraction of the torn edges.  In acute ruptures, the gap between the rupture will have intermediate T1 signal and high T2 signal due to edema and acute hemorrhage.  In chronic ruptures, scar or fat signal will ususally predominate.(3)\n\n     Treatment of Achilles rupture is controversial and there are advantages and disadvantages to conservative nonsurgical treatment versus surgical treatment.  Nonsurgical treatment avoids surgical morbidity and cost, but rerupture rates are as high as 39%.  Surgical treatment has higher cost and morbidity, but lower rerupture rates.(1)",

This proliferation replaces normal bone marrow and often results in extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, osteopenia, and/or pathologic fractures.  \n\nThe etiology of multiple myeloma is unknown.  It is more common in the elderly and there is a slight increased risk among children and siblings of multiple myeloma patients.  There is also an increased incidence amongst petroleum, leather, and cosmetology workers.  Additionally, exposure to radiation (greater than 50 rad), hebricides, insecticides, heavy metals, plastics, and asbestos also increases risk.  \n\n\u201cPunched-out\u201d lytic lesions are a common finding on plain film.  An osteolytic skull lesion is the best diagnostic clue on imaging.  The appearance can vary on T1-weighted MRI, ranging from focal hyperintensity in 53% of cases to a focal hypointensity in 25% of cases.  Marked lesional enhancement is seen following gadolinium administration.  On T2 weighted imaging, an iso- to hyperintense lesion can be seen.  Intracranial myeloma, as in this patient, is a rare finding.\n\n\nReferences: \n\nAngtuaco EJ, et al.  Multiple myeloma: clinical review and diagnostic imaging.

            "Discussion": "A prevalent sequela of diabetic foot ulcers is osteomyelitis.1  In fact, almost all diabetic foot infections originate from an ulcer (> 85%), making prompt diagnosis and aggressive management essential in preventing later amputation.2  A diabetic\u2019s peripheral neuropathy causes \u201cdecreased pedal sensation that leads to undetected mechanical and thermal injuries; excessive and repetitive pressure on plantar bony prominences, especially the metatarsal heads; gait disturbances and foot deformities that increase focal pressure; and autonomic neuropathy that leads to decreased sweating and dry, cracked skin.\u201d1  This coupled with a diabetic\u2019s peripheral vascular disease, peripheral motor neuropathy, dysfunctional immune system, and poor wound healing, increases the likelihood of an organism gaining a foothold in and causing an infection of the underlying bone.1\n\nWhile osteomyelitis in an otherwise normal patient would present with fever, chills, and local signs of infection (i.e., purulent drainage, erythema, warmth, and tenderness), the diabetic patient with osteomyelitis of the foot may be devoid of any or all of these symptoms.1  Often, \u201crecalcitrant hyperglycemia is the only systemic sign\u201d of osteomyelitis of the foot, and fever and chills are absent in up to 67% of infected patients.1  In short, the clinical diagnosis of osteomyelitis in this setting is poor.1  Therefore, clinicians must either resort to a bone biopsy or use diagnostic imaging.  A bone biopsy is a surgical procedure, is time consuming and not without risk, and is expensive, whereas imaging is essentially noninvasive, provides rapid results with very little risk to the patient, and relative to surgery is inexpensive.  Therefore, it is the modality used to make a diagnosis in these patients, although biopsy is occasionally needed for confirmation, particularly when patients have neuropathic joints and osteomyelitis.\n\nRadiographs of the foot are the easiest and least expensive imaging studies.1  However, \u201cthe sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot are 60% and 66% respectively.\u201d1  Unfortunately, osteomyelitis must be present for 10 to 21 days before the infection is detectable on plain radiographs and a patient with severe neuropathic bone disease will have a similar appearing study.1  However, radiographs should be the initial imaging study, not only due to its ease and economy, but also as a baseline.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test for diagnosing osteomyelitis with a sensitivity and specificity of 99% and 83% respectively and demonstrates excellent contrast between the soft tissues and bones and pathological conditions such as osteomyelitis, myositis, and cellulitis.1  The main drawback of MRI in this role is cost.1  On T1-weighted MR images of the bone marrow, osteomyelitis causes a decreased signal intensity, but T2-weighted MR images with fat saturation and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) MR images of involved bone marrow will show an increased signal intensity.1,3  On contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images with fat saturation, areas of osteomyelitis will enhance.  MRI can also detect the diabetic ulceration, and sometimes the sinus tract from osteomyelitis to ulcer.  The addition of contrast-enhanced MRI allows the detection of nonenhancing necrosis, which is important to recognize for debridement.\n\n1. Schinabeck MK, Johnson JL.

            "Disease Discussion": "Osteomyelitis is infection of bone, usually bacterial in origin.  Microbes can reach bone by three mechanisms: hematogenous spread, extension from a contiguous site of infection, and direct introduction of organisms into bone by trauma and surgery.  \n\nAcute hematogenous osteomyelitis involves bone with red marrow.  In children, most commonly affected are the long bones with relatively slow flow in metaphyseal sinusoidal veins and a paucity of phagocytes.  Infection is often secondary to staphylococcal skin infections.  In adults, acute osteo rarely involves the long bones because adipose tissue has replaced red marrow.  Instead, it most commonly occurs in vertebral bodies, where the marrow is cellular and has abundant vascular supply.  Septicemia is usually the inciting event.\n\nExtension from a contiguous site of infection is a common cause for osteomyelitis.  Infection following trauma, radiation therapy, burns or pressure sores.  In patients with vascular insufficiency, organisms can enter the soft tissues through a cutaneous ulcer, often in the foot, and cause cellulitis, then osteomyelitis.\n\nDirect introduction of organisms into the bone may occur during open fractures, open surgical reduction of closed fractures, or penetrating trauma by foreign bodies such as bullets.  May also arise from perioperative  contamination of bone during laminectomy, diskectomy, or joint prosthesis.  The causitive organism is typically normal flora, such as Staph Epidermidis.",

Cerebral infarction complicates up to 95% of spontaneous vertebral artery dissections, but prognosis is good with 90% of affected patients approaching full recovery.  Traumatic vertebral artery injury associated with cervical spine fractures is common (40%) but remains largely asymptomatic even with complete vessel occlusion.  \nSymptoms of vertebral artery dissection include headache and neck pain, with either abrupt or evolving gait, ocular or vestibular disturbances.  Vertebral artery dissection is commonly spontaneous or due to mild trauma such as sneezing or head turning which can stretch the artery over the lateral mass of C2.  Hyperextension may also stretch the vertebral artery at C1-2 where it exits the transverse foramen.  Conditions which predispose to arterial dissection include fibromuscular displasia, cystic medial necrosis, Marfan\u2019s Syndrome and homocysteinuria.  \nWhile clinicians may place great emphasis on MR angiography for evaluation of the cervical arteries, standard spin-echo MRI has much greater sensitivity than MRA for dissection in the vertebral arteries (60% vs. 20%).

Although this patient had no known history of hypertension, her CT and MRI both demonstrate evidence of chronic small vessel ischemia secondary to longstanding hypertension.  The differential diagnosis for a hemorrhagic lesion in the putamen/posterior capsule includes lacunar infarct, hypertensive hemorrhage, vascular malformation, and neoplasm.\n\nLacunar infarcts represent 15-20% of all strokes, and appear as small cavitary lesions in subcortical regions.  They result from the thrombosis of a small penetrating artery, often as a result of a chronic hypertensive change known as lipohyalinosis.  Characteristic locations for lacunar infarcts include the following:  putamen (37%), pons (16%), thalamus (14%), caudate (10%), and internal capsule (10%).  Posterior limb lacunes are the most important clinically because of their potential for severe motor and sensory deficits.  Anterior limb lacunes are often clincally silent.\nThese \"perforating\" arteries (lenticulostriate aa., thalamogeniculate aa., and anterior choroidal branch of ICA) are common sites for both lacunar infarcts and hypertensive hemorrhage, and both types of lesions can result from a process known as lipohyalinosis.  This is the impregnation of hyaline-lipid material into the walls of small arteries in the setting of hypertension combined with atherosclerosis.  Lipohyalinosis predisposes the artery to thrombosis and may also weaken the vessel wall, resulting in small dissecting \"Charcot-Bouchard\" aneurysms.\n\nHypertensive hemorrhages are slightly less common than lacunar infarcts, representing 10-15% of all strokes.  Two-thirds of hypertensive hemorrhages occur in the putamen, but most cases occur in the presence of systolic blood pressures much higher than 170.  Active bleeding usually lasts less than one hour, while edema progresses over the next few days.  Complications of hypertensive hemorrhage include brain herniation and hydrocephalus.",

            "Title": "Ependymoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Ependymomas are an uncommon group of glial tumors. They account for less than 10 percent of central nervous system (CNS) lesions and 25 percent of spinal cord tumors. The incidence of these tumors is approximately equal between males and females. The median age at diagnosis is five years of age with 25-40% of patients being less than two years old. Ependymomas typically arise within or adjacent to the ependymal lining of the ventricular system; they occasionally occur within the brain parenchyma, and rarely outside the CNS. In children, approximately 90 percent of ependymomas are intracranial (60 percent in the posterior fossa); the remainder arise within the spinal cord. In adults, approximately 75 percent arise within the spinal canal. The fourth ventricle is the most common infratentorial site and extension into the subarachnoid space occurs frequently. Supratentorial lesions can be either intraventricular (most commonly in the lateral ventricles) or parenchymal.  The biology and natural history of ependymomas resemble those of low-grade gliomas; as a result, local growth is predominant and less than 5 percent present with metastatic disease.\n\nEpendymomas are usually well demarcated with frequent areas of calcification, hemorrhage, and cysts. Ependymomas span a histologic appearance from low grade (WHO grade II) differentiated lesions (ependymoma or myxopapillary ependymoma) to anaplastic (WHO grade III) tumors. Rarer subtypes of ependymoma include cellular, papillary, and clear cell variants. Myxopapillary ependymoma is composed of morphologically distinct cells from nonmyxopapillary or regular ependymoma. It arises within the region of the conus medullaris and filum terminale and appears much less malignant than does regular ependymoma. These lesions are classified as grade I, or low grade.\n\nThe clinical presentation of ependymoma is dependent upon tumor location. Most patients with posterior fossa lesions have evidence of increased intracranial pressure. As a result, headache, nausea and vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, and papilledema are common at presentation. Cranial nerve palsies are very common, especially involving cranial nerves VI to X. Brain stem invasion may occur. Seizures or focal neurologic deficits are most prominent when the tumors arise in the supratentorial compartment. Tumors involving the spinal cord present with deficits related to involvement of ascending or descending nerve tracts, or exiting peripheral nerves, that are specific to the level of the tumor.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for tumors that present in the posterior fossa includes medulloblastoma, astrocytoma, and brain stem or choroid plexus tumors. In the supratentorial location, glial tumors, PNETs, and choroid plexus carcinoma or papilloma should be considered. The CT appearance is often hyperdense with homogeneous enhancement; cysts and calcifications are common. The presence of calcifications within a tumor located in the fourth ventricle is highly suggestive but not diagnostic of ependymoma. On MRI, these tumors have a hypointense appearance on T1, and are hyperintense on T2 or proton density images; gadolinium enhancement is usually prominent. A subependymoma should be suspected in adults who present with a long clinical history and evidence of a non-enhancing, well-demarcated, nodular intraventricular tumor that is isodense on CT, and isointense in T1 and hyperintense in T2-weighted images on MRI. Stereotactic biopsy or surgical resection are necessary for the diagnosis of ependymoma. All patients should have spinal imaging of the entire neuraxis by MRI to exclude metastatic disease, since up to 10 percent of patients have evidence of spinal seeding.\n\nStandard therapy for ependymoma consists of resection, usually followed by adjuvant radiotherapy. Chemotherapy does not appear to play an important role in the management of these tumors in adults but does in children. \n\nIt is difficult to estimate prognosis precisely in patients with ependymoma. In addition to tumor location, the extent of surgical resection and grade of malignancy have been identified as important factors in some studies. Approximately 90 percent of recurrences are local, underscoring the importance of local therapy to outcome. Supratentorial tumors appear to have a better prognosis than those located infratentorially. The risk of recurrence with myxopapillary and subependymoma is low and the prognosis is generally excellent for patients with these low grade tumors. High grade ependymomas are associated with poor outcome in most studies. In children, better performance status and older age are also associated with better prognosis. Compared to older children, infants may do less well partly because they have a higher incidence of infratentorial tumors, and partly because they tend not to receive timely adjuvant radiotherapy due to toxic effects on brain development.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Gray matter heterotopias are collections of normal neurons in abnormal locations.  They result from an arrest of the normal outward radial migration of neurons.  Therefore, one could say that all neuronal migration anomalies are heterotopias.  However, the term heterotopia is restricted in its use to neurons that lie either in the subependymal region or within the cerebral hemispheric white matter.\n\nSymptomatic patients with gray matter heterotopias almost always present with a seizure disorder.  Developmental delay may be present if the arrest of neuronal migration has been extremely severe or if associated anomalies are present.  MR is extremely sensitive to the presence of heterotopias; therefore, incidental heterotopias are now occasionally identified in patients who are minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic.\n\nThree major forms of heterotopic gray matter have been described:  subependymal nodules (Films .1 and .2); deep white matter nodules (Films .3 and .4); and deep bands of gray matter (band heterotopia) embedded in the white matter.  Films .5 and .6 show a band heterotopia in which a circumferential band of ectopic neurons sits within the cerebral hemisphere.  Normal white matter tracts separate this band from the lateral ventricles and from the overlying cortex.  Because they are very symmetric, band heterotopias are often overlooked by inexperienced imagers.  A high index of suspicion is necessary to make the diagnosis.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The lateral femoral notch (lateral condylopatellar sulcus) is normally a shallow groove in the mid lateral femoral condyle.  The groove is formed by the junction of the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral curvature.  The sulcus is typically less than 2mm in depth and is more conspicuous than the medial sulcus due to its parallel alignment with the x-ray. The depth of the lateral sulcus can be measured by drawing a line tangential to the sulcus on the articular surface.  The \u201clateral femoral notch sign\u201d is a result of anterior subluxation of the tibia with impaction of the lateral femoral condyle on the posterolateral tibial plateau.  This pattern of injury is described as \u201ckissing contusions\u201d.  \n\nThe finding of a deep lateral femoral notch has been associated with anterior cruciate ligament tears. Cobby et al found that a sulcus 1.5mm or deeper is a reliable indirect sign of a torn ACL. However, this sign was only present in 12% of patients with ACL tear.  Garth et al also found a statistically significant association with lateral meniscus tears as well, in particular the anterior horn.  \n\nWhile the lateral femoral notch sign occurs infrequently with ACL tears, careful attention to this area on the lateral radiograph of the knee can be a reliable indicator of internal deraingement of the knee.",

CT-guided percutaneous radiofrequency ablation has become the treatment of choice for most osteoid osteomas located in the appendicular skeleton and pelvis, and a success rate of 91% has been demonstrated.   After needle biopsy, the radiofrequency electrode is introduced under CT guidance and the tip is heated to 90?C and maintained for 3-6 minutes.  This technique is limited because the electrode must be positioned at least 1 cm away from major nerves.  Therefore, lesions in some locations such as the hand or vertebral column make poor candidates."

            "Title": "Osteoid osteoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Osteoid osteoma is a benign tumor of the bone, which accounts for approximately 12% 2of all benign skeletal tumors.  Over 50% of the time this tumor occurs in the proximal femur and tibia with another 13% occurring in the vertebral columns, especially the posterior elements.1  Generally, these lesions occur in the intracortical and diaphyseal portions of the long bones, although they can occur in the metaphysis of the bone as well.2  The typical history associated with an osteoid osteoma is that of a person in his or her teens to twenties with nocturnal pain which responds well to aspirin.2,3  The radiologic findings of this tumor classically consist of a small (usually less than 1.5 to 2 cm) sclerotic lesion with a cortically based radiolucency (nidus).2  Surrounding the sclerosis is cortical thickening which is secondary to an extensive surrounding inflammatory response.2  While this appearance may be evident on plain film, often a CT or MRI is necessary to identify these characteristic changes, however, MRI should be used with the understanding that this method of imaging can make the appearance of an osteoid osteoma confusing.  MRI will show the sometimes extensive bone marrow reactions (which correlate with replacement of normal marrow with fibrous tissue, inflammatory cells, and hypervascularity) and soft tissue inflammation which are associated with an osteoid osteoma and the calcified nidus is often not seen with this imaging modality.  Instead, MRI can suggest that a more aggressive process is occurring, such as malignancy, infection, or fracture.2   Intra-articular osteoid osteomas create problems not seen with the typical diaphyseal lesion.  These can cause joint effusion and lymhoproliferative synovitis, and may suggest an arthritic condition.  Indeed, this may lead to osteoarthritis in up to half of these patients.2 In the diagnosis of osteoid osteoma, the classic appearance on plain film or CT in addition to the classic history which appears in this case generally makes the diagnosis for the radiologist and the clinician.  However there are several important other processes which are necessary to rule out.  The most important of these processes is an osteosarcoma.  This condition typically will not have the central nidus of calcification, but more importantly it will not respect the boundaries which an osteoid osteoma respects and stay in the cortex of the bone.  While the pain may occur more strongly at night, the patient will typically not obtain strong relief from aspirin or other NSAIDs, as he or she will with an osteoid osteoma.Of the conditions which do respect the boundaries of the bone and are localized to the cortex, there are only three possibilities: osteiod osteoma, Langerhan\u2019s cell histiocytosis, and Brodie\u2019s abscess.2  Langerhan\u2019s cell histiocytosis typically occurs in the skull and spine, with typical lesions being lytic with well defined margins.  Skull lesions have sharply defined punched out boarders (giving rise to \u201cgeographic skull\u201d); spine lesions lead to variable compression of the vertebral bodies.2  Brodie\u2019s abscess is a subacute osteomyelitis that commonly occurs as a well defined osteolytic metaphyseal lesion.  It has a sclerotic margin that fades peripherally, creating a \u201cfuzzy\u201d appearance.  There is no central nidus.  Occasionally Brodie\u2019s abscess occurs as a serpiginous lucency in the metaphysis of the long bone.  These findings are often pathognomonic on plain fims.  The most common causative organism is S. aureus. 4",

            "Title": "Clival Chordoma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Chordomas are rare, histologically benign but aggressive tumors arising from  remnants of the embryonic notochord.  They usually lie in the sacrococcygeal area (50%) or the clivus (35%).  These tumors most often affect patients greater than 30 years of age.\n\nClival chordomas comprise less that 2% of intracranial tumors. They typically arise within the bone and are therefore extradural.  They also invade the surrounding bone and may extend to compress adjacent structures such as cranial nerves and the brain stem.\n\nClival chordomas are usually of a gelatinous consistency and may have secondary hemorrhage and necrosis. These changes can be present throughout the tumor.  \n\nMicroscopically, physaliphorus cells are seen, that contain large cytoplasmic vacuoles rich in glycogen and mucin.  These are separated into nests by fibrous sheets.  \n\nImmunohistochemistry reveals positive staining for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen.  Chondroid chordomas, a more benign subtype, typically contains hyaline cartilage.\n\nBoth CT and MR are used to diagnose and delineate the extent of clival chordomas.  On CT, adjacent bone destruction is seen, and areas of low attenuation in the mass may represent the gelatinous matrix.  Calcification is occasionally seen inside the mass.\n\nOn MR, high signal intensity is seen on T2-weighted images.  These tumors are usually iso or hypo-intense on T1-weighted imaging with areas of occasional high signal intensity, representing blood or mucin.\n\nAfter administration of gadolinium contrast, these tumors typically demonstrate heterogenous enhancement, and typically have a \u201choneycomb\u201d appearance, due their lobular organization.\n\nMR also is useful to characterize possible internal carotid or vertebrobasilar encasement.\n\nTreatment for clival chordomas usually consists of a dual approach: surgical removal and radiation.  Depending upon direction of growth of the chordoma, a transphenoidal, transmaxillary, transbasal, cranioorbitozygomatic, or transcondylar approach may be used.  Occasionally, subtotal resection of the mass is performed, due to high risk of injury to adjacent neurovascular structures.  Potential complications include stroke, cranial nerve palsy, CSF leak, and meningitis.\n\nProton beam therapy has been the mainstay of radiation treatment for clival chordomas.  Any form of radiation is given postoperatively, and in most cases, traditional forms of treatment are avoided to limit the amount of injury to vital surrounding structures.  A study performed by Pearlman and Friedman showed an 80% local control rate with a minimum of 80 Gy and only 20% control rate with 40 to 60 Gy.\n\nAlthough histologically benign, clival chordomas have a high rate of recurrence, which may be related to sub-total resection.  Distant metastases are uncommon.  Survival rate approaches 50% at five years and 30% at ten years.  Greater extent of resection is correlated with improved survival.",

            "Disease Discussion": "In pediatric patients, fractures through the physis represent a serious clinical concern as they can lead to potentially poor outcomes if they are not accurately diagnosed and treated appropriately.  The Salter Harris radiologic classification system of physeal fractures is the most commonly utilized method of describing these fractures.  This system divides fractures into five types depending upon the involvement of the physis, epiphysis, or metaphysis.\n\nType I fractures are transverse through the hypertrophic zone of the physis and results in widening of the physis.  In these injuries, the growing zone of the physis is typically not disturbed and overall growth disturbance is uncommon.\n\nType II fractures traverse the metaphysis and physis, but do not involve the epiphysis.  This represents the most common type of physeal fracture, accounting for up to 75% of injuries.  While these may result in mild limb foreshortening, functional limitations are rare.\n\nType III fractures traverse the physis and the epiphysis, but spare the metaphysis.  These represent a more serious clinical issue, as they tend to involve the articular cartilage and have a greater predisposition for growth arrest.\n\nType IV fractures involve the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis.  Like the type III injury, these fractures have a greater predisposition for growth arrest.\n\nType V fractures result from a crush injury to all or part of the physis.  Initial diagnosis may be dificult radiographically without specific clinical data.  Often the diagnosis is made in follow up, after partial or complete boney fusion across the physeal plate has ensued.\n\nWhile it has been estimated that nearly 30% of these fractures result in growth plate disturbance, only 2% result in significant functional disability.",

Peak occurrence in between ages 10-15 years. They are rarely found in patients over 25 years of age.\n\nDisease course: The most frequent presentation is a child with an unrelated injury whose NOF is found on plain radiographs.  However, a child can sometime present with an NOF as the etiology for a primary complaint when the NOF causes noticeable deformity or pain.  Rarely, an NOF presents as pathologic fracture, usually when the lesion occupies more than 50% of the bone diameter.  NOFs of all presentations may increase or decrease in size before spontaneously resolving.\n\nDx: The diagnosis of NOF is usually made as an incidental finding on a radiograph obtained for other reasons.  The diagnosis can be made on radiographs alone due to its characteristic appearance; a lucent, lobulated lesion that is well defined with an eccentric epicenter and defined, often sclerotic margin.\n\nDifferential Dx: \n*Fibrous cortical defect (defined as 0-2 cm and confined to cortex)\n*Osteoblastoma (suggested by ossification and calcification)\n*Adamantinoma (suggested by medullary invasion)\n*Osteoid osteoma (usually has a central nidus and is painful) \n\nTreatment: Unless symptomatic, these lesions are managed conservatively and no work-up is indicated.  If a malignant process is suspected, biopsy will yield the definitive diagnosis.  In the case of larger lesions where pathologic fracture has occurred or because of the size of the NOF, the patient may be prone to pathologic fracture, curettage with bone graft is performed.  Such intervention is usually reserved for cases in which the lesion occupies more than 50% of the diameter of a weight-bearing bone, or the lesion is greater than 33 mm in diameter.",

Additional radiographic characteristics of Scheuermann kyphosis include endplate irregularities and Schmorl's nodes.\n\nScheuermann kyphosis is estimated to affect approximately 4 to 8 percent of the general population, with a slightly higher incidence reported in males when compared to females.  \n\nClinical presentation typically occurs in early adolescence with parents noticing the deformity, or with children complaining of back pain.  Pain associated with this deformity is characteristically located just distal to the apex of the deformity and radiates laterally in a paraspinal pattern.  \n\nThe etiology of this disorder remains unclear, although most investigators agree that mechanical factors involving axial loading play some role in the pathogenesis.\n\nTreatment options for Scheuermann kyphosis depend upon the degree of deformity and its associated symptoms.  The typical approach includes conservative management with non-steroidal pain medications, physical therapy, and bracing, and more aggressive treatment with surgical correction.",

The incidence of hip fractures is rising in parallel with the rising age of our population, leading to increased disability and medical cost. Advancing age is the greatest risk factor for hip fractures; other risk factors include being Caucasian and female, having a maternal history of hip fracture, having decreased bone density, visual impairment or dementia, a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, a history of glucocorticoid, benzodiazepine or anticonvulsant use, or a history of hyperthyroidism. \n\nHip fractures often have a significant impact on the life of the person affected. Between 15-20% of elderly patients with a hip fracture die within one year of the injury. Half of the patients with a hip fractures who had previously lived independently are unable to do so following the fracture. In addition to the significant mortality, patients with hip fractures and their surgical correction are at risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, delirium, and global deterioration of functionality. \n\nPatients with hip fractures often have a history of a fall followed by pain in the hip, groin, buttocks or back. They may have difficulty walking or bearing weight after the fall. On physical exam, there may be shortening and external rotation of the affected lower extremity. A history of trauma is not necessary, however, and patients with risk factors who present with hip pain or difficulty bearing weight should be evaluated thoroughly for an occult hip fracture and for osteoporosis that is often found in the elderly age group.\n\nTo evaluate for possible femoral fractures, radiographs should be done first. However, in patients with negative radiographs but a high clinical suspicion for fracture, MR imaging is the best imaging test to diagnose a fracture missed on plain radiographs. Early diagnosis is important in order that the hip fractures can be surgically corrected, preferably within 2-3 days of injury in order to reduce hospitalization and morbidity. \n\nIngari et al showed that low-signal-intensity on T1-weighted MR images were correlative with non-displaced fractures induced in cadavers. In contrast, the high-signal-intensity that is seen on the T2-weighted MR image may represent the fracture and secondary post-traumatic edema and inflammation and may appear more extensive than the actual fracture. MR should therefore be acquired without delay if plain radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high.\n\nIf MR imaging is not available, bone scans of the hip can be useful for identifying proximal femoral fractures. However, bone scans demonstrate fracture because of the increased metabolic activity surrounding the injury; in the elderly, the bone scans may not be positive until 3 days after injury. This delay can have a negative impact on the patient\u2019s ultimate recovery. Therefore if MR imaging is available, it is the imaging test of choice in the patient with suspected hip fracture but with negative radiographs.\n\nHip fractures in the elderly have a significant rate of morbidity and mortality. Fractures of the femoral neck can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to disrupted blood supply from the lateral circumflex femoral artery. Fractures can also lead to malunion or nonunion between fragments as well as degenerative changes in the hip joint. Also, as mentioned previously, people who suffer a hip fracture are at significant risk for developing deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, delirium, infections, and decreased conditioning and functionality. Extended periods of hospitalization and limited mobility combine to create a major obstacle to the elderly person who may never be able to recover fully.\n\nPreventive measures are important in preventing hip fractures in the elderly. The USPSTF recommends routine bone mineral density screening for women after age 65 years, and after age 60 years in high risk women. Treatment of those with decreased bone density with bisphosphonates has been shown to reduce fracture risk. High-dose oral vitamin D supplementation has also been shown to reduce the risk of fractures. Modifiable lifestyle factors include smoking cessation and weight-bearing exercise. \n\nIn patients with hip fractures, early diagnosis and surgical fixation have been shown to reduce hospitalization and adverse events. Aggressive physical therapy is also very important in returning a patient to a functional level as close to baseline as possible. Plain radiographs are the first diagnostic imaging study for evaluating for hip fracture. However, if these are negative but clinical suspicion remains high for a fracture, MR imaging should be done for definitive diagnosis. \n\nReferences:\n\nBeaupre L, Jones A, Saunders D, Johnston W, Buckingham J, Majumdar S.

            "Discussion": "Parsonage-Turner syndrome (PTS), also known as acute brachial neuritis and neuralgic amyotrophy, defines a set of symptoms resulting from inflammation of the brachial plexus. \n\nPTS is idiopathic in etiology, but thought to be post viral and may follow illness, surgery, or immunization.  Up to 50% report viral illness or vaccination that occurred days to weeks prior to onset of symptoms.\n\nParsonage Turner syndrome presents as the acute onset of severe shoulder pain followed shortly thereafter by weakness of at least one shoulder muscle.  Bilateral involvement has been reported for as many as one third of patients.  It can be confused clinically with cervical spondylosis, rotator cuff tear, shoulder impingement syndrome, and acute calcific tendonitis.  Failure to identify PTS may result in inappropriate treatment or potnentially unnecessary surgery.\n\nPTS may involve single or multiple nerves originating from the brachial plexus.  The suprascapular is the most commonly affected (97% of cases), followed by the axillary (50% of cases) and far less commonly the subscapular and long thoracic.  In cases involving the suprascapular nerve, the supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles are affected.  Inflammation of the subscapular nerve affects the subscapularis muscle.  The serratous anterior muscle is affected when the long thoracic nerve is involved, and the teres minor and deltoid muscles are affected in cases involving an axillary nerve distribution.\n\nThe MR finding most typical of PTS is that of diffuse high T2 signal involving one or more muscles innervated by the brachial plexus.  T1-weighted images may also show atrophy of the affected muscle(s). The pattern of muscular involvement should match the distribution(s) of one or more peripheral nerves originating from the brachial plexus\n\nNo test can be used to diagnose PTS specifically. Both electromyograms and MR images must be interpreted with consideration of the clinical history.  The disorder is self-limited, but can take up to a year to resolve.  Residual denervation can be seen in 10-20% of cases after 2 years.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nGaskins CM, Helms CA.  Parsonage-Turner syndrome: MR imaging findings and clinical information of 27 patients.

            "Discussion": "The administration of intra-articular gadolinium can be helpful in clearly demonstrating a SLAP lesion on MR imaging. On the coronal images, the superior labrum normally appears as a black triangle extending off of the superior glenoid. Any signal extending into the substance of the triangle is abnormal and represents a SLAP lesion. This can be differentiated from the normal variant sublabral recess, because in a sublabral recess the contrast collection appears smooth and tapering and extends toward the base of the triangle, rather than into the substance of the triangle, as in this SLAP lesion. A sublaral foramen can be differentiated from a SLAP lesion, because a sublabral foramen occurs in the anterior quadrant rather than posterior quadrant and as in the sublabral recess, the contrast collection is smooth and tapering in appearance rather than irregular as demonstrated in this SLAP tear.\nWhen describing a SLAP lesion, it is important to describe the extent of the lesion from front to back, as well as to describe whether there is involvement of the biceps anchor. When using direct MR arthrography, the biceps anchor is usually best evaluated on the axial and sagittal images."

            "Disease Discussion": "SLAP stands for Superior Labrum from Anterior-to-Posterior, (relative to the biceps tendon anchor).\n\nThere are four types of SLAP tears. In type I lesions consist of a frayed and degenerative superior labrum with a normal biceps tendon anchor. Type II lesions demonstrate detachment of the superior labrum and biceps anchor and  may also be associated with anterior glenohumeral joint dislocation and anterior instability. SLAP types I and II may be difficult to separate on MRI, depending on the technique used for diagnosis.  Type III lesions involve a bucket-handle tear of the superior labrum (a vertical tear through a meniscoid-like superior labrum) without extension into the biceps tendon.  The biceps anchor is stable and the remaining labrum is intact. Type IV lesions also involve a bucket-handle tear associated with a meniscoid-type superior labrum, but in this case with extension into the biceps tendon. The biceps anchor and the superior labrum are well attached. A partially torn biceps tendon may displace the superior labral flap into the joint. A complex SLAP lesion may consist of a combination of two or more types, usually type II and type IV.\n\nPossible mechanisms of injury include a fall on the outstretched abducted arm with associated superior joint compression and a proximal subluxation force or a sudden contraction of the biceps tendon, which avulses the superior labrum. Repetitive stress acting through the biceps tendon or instability of the glenohumeral joint may also produce SLAP lesions. \n\nTreatment of SLAP lesions is based on the type of labral lesion present. A type I SLAP lesion is treated with arthroscopic debridement of the degenerative labrum. Treatment of a type II SLAP lesion (which involves detachment of the superior labrum and biceps anchor) addresses the avulsed labrum and reattachment of the detached biceps anchor to the superior glenoid. A suture anchor technique, for example, may be used for a type II SLAP tear.",

These lesions typically present in young adults in the  2nd to 5th   decade   with   complaints  referable  to  acute  or  chronic hydrocephalus.  Other symptoms include ataxia, memory disturbances, and gait disorders.    The  cyst  contents  include  secretory  and breakdown  products  of the epithelial lining tissue, including hemorrhage, lipid (cholesterol), hemosiderin, and CSF.  \n\nOn  T1-weighted MR images, these cysts vary widely from hypo- to hyperintense in comparison to normal brain.  Although they may be bright on T2-weighted images, moderate  to  marked hypointensity  is  common and has been attributed to a very  short  T1  relaxation  time  or  to  magnetic susceptibility effect from paramagnetic substances in the cyst.  On noncontrast  MR,  these lesions occasionally are indistinguishable by intensity from neoplasia; however, the absence  of  enhancement, classic location,  and  relative hypointensity  on  T2-weighted studies should suggest this diagnosis.  Treatment is variable, including  ventricular  shunting alone, stereotactic cyst drainage, or surgical resection.\n\nOn  noncontrast CT, colloid cysts are solitary, round to oval, usually hyperdense masses at the foramen of Monro  with  associated enlargement  of  one or both lateral ventricles (Film .3).  Minimal or absent contrast enhancement is typical.  Moderate  enhancement with  contrast  suggests  a  different  etiology,  such  as glioma, craniopharyngioma, choroid plexus papilloma,  or  remotely  meningioma.

The disease may affect the entire GI tract and does so in a characteristic discontinuous and asymmetric pattern. Males and females are affected equally and usually present between ages 15 and 30. Symptoms vary but most commonly include abdominal pain with diarrhea, which may be bloody. Other symptoms include low-grade fever, anorexia and weight loss, anemia, perianal abscess/fistula and malabsorption. \n\nThe small bowel is most frequently involved followed by the colon. The terminal ileum alone or in combination with other sites is involved in 95% of cases. Typical findings on small bowel follow-through include fold thickening with nodularity, aphthous ulcers and cobblestone mucosa and ulceration. Crohn or granulomatous colitis occurs most frequently on the right side with sparing of the rectosigmoid. Often small nodular filling defects are seen with aphthous ulcers. Discontinuous involvement or \"skip lesions\" throughout the bowel are characteristic. Complications include fistulae, sinus tracts, abscesses, perforation, toxic megacolon and increased risk for bowel lymphoma and adenocarcinoma. \n\nFindings on CT include thickened bowel wall potentially with skip areas, \"creeping fat\" due to mesenteric fat proliferation, vascular dilation and tortuosity, mesenteric adenopathy, fistula, stricture or abscess. Although complications may be treated surgically, primary therapy is medical as recurrence rate after resection is up to 39%. \n\nThere are many extraintestinal manifestations including gallstones, urolithiasis, uveitis and arthritis.

            "Disease Discussion": "NF-1 is a congenital disease causing benign tumors of peripheral nerves.  These tumors are formed by hyperproliferation of the nerve sheath cells.  Although they can occasionally undergo malignant transformation, invade CNS spaces, or cause mental retardation, significant morbidity can result from hundreds of disfiguring neurofibromas and pedunculated molluscum fibrosum visible from a long distance.  The psychological impact and physical inconvenience of such lesions cannot be overstated.  \n\tNF-1 is disease whose gene with autosomal dominant inheritance involving an NF-1 gene on chromosome 17.  However, as many as half of cases occur by spontaneous genetic defect with no known parental disease.  This genetic defect is found in nearly 1 per 3000 births with varying expression.  There is no increased incidence by sex or race.\n\tThe diagnosis is generally made in childhood or adolescence due to the appearance of caf?-au-lait macules.  The disfiguring cutaneous neurfibromas and molluscum fibrosum generally appear a few years later, but the number of cutaneous lesions may grow into the hundreds.  Diagnosis using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Consensus Development Conference Criteria can be made with two of the following:  six or more caf?-au-lait macules; two or more neurofibromas of any type or one plexiform neurofibroma; axillary or inguinal freckles; bilateral optic glioma; two Lisch nodules (iris hematomas); osseous dysplasia (sphenoid wing, occipital, or tibial pseudoarthrosis); or first degree relative with NF-1.  Scoliosis is also not uncommon.\n\tRadiologic studies are not typically required for diagnosis of NF-1, but may be needed to assess lesion growth around critical nerve structures, particularly when focal neurological dysfunction is present.  Furthermore, there is an increased incidence of certain tumors (including optic gliomas, acoustic neuromas, pheochromocytomas, astrocytomas, meningiomas, ependymomas, etc.) in NF-1 patients, so there is generally a low threshold for imaging studies in symptomatic patients.  However, there is no protocol for periodic imaging unless indicated by clinical exam or for follow-up of previously identified lesions.  The T2-weighted MRI is generally the best study for imaging neurofibromas due to a large amount of water in the neurofibroma lesions. \n\tTreatment of NF-1 is primarly limited to surgical resection of symptomatic lesions, such as one at the waist line that generates pain with clothing wear.  In addition, neurofibromas which create neurological symptoms are debulked if possible.  There are some experimental medical oncologic protocols, but no cure or remission agent yet.",

            "Title": "aortic coarctation",
            "Disease Discussion": "The term coarctation is derived from the Latin word coarctation, meaning a drawing or pressing together. In medical terminology, coarctation refers to a localized narrowing of the lumen of a vessel producing an obstruction to flow.   Coarctation of the aorta typically occurs in the \"juxta-ductal\" part of the aorta, or the part near where the ductus arteriosus attaches near the aortic isthmus. Depending on the exact location of the constriction of the aorta, it can be classified as either preductal / isthmic (infantile) coarctation or postductal / juxtaductal (adult type) coarctation. The most frequently encountered type is the postductal / juxtaductal variety.  In the postductal type, the area of the coarctation is located at, or just distal to, the level of the left subclavian artery and ductus arteriosus and usually is short and discrete. In the rarer second type, (preductal, isthmic, or infantile) the area of narrowing usually lies proximal to the ductus arteriosus, somewhere between the left subclavian artery and the left carotid artery. Preductal coarctation is associated with an increased incidence of cardiac defects, and as preductal coarctations do not significantly alter normal fetal blood flow patterns, no collaterals form in utero hence they are typically not seen later in life. Several surgical methods of repair are employed, including end-to-end reanastomosis, subclavian flap aortoplasty, prosthetic patch onlay grafts, and interposition grafts.    Usually, the presence of coarctation alone is indication for an operation. Several techniques are currently used to repair coarctation of the aorta and the method of repair employed is usually tailored specifically to each patient.  Follow-up for these patients depends upon the clinical response to the intervention. The most common complications after coarctation repair are late restenosis and aneurysm formation at the repair site. One of the most common methods of repair of coarctation of the aorta is resection of the involved segment with end-to-end reanastomosis.  Some of the benefits of this particular technique include avoidance of prosthetic materials, excision of ductal tissue, preservation of the left subclavian artery, and relief of left ventricular outflow obstruction.  The current trend in management is to attempt a corrective surgery in neonates and to try transcatheter balloon dilation before surgery in older children and adults. Recently, treatment of aortic coarctation by percutatious catheter interventions has become more widespread, using both balloon dilation and primary stent implantation techniques. These techniques were first regarded mainly as a procedure for the treatment of recurrent coarctation. However, they have gained more widespread acceptance as a procedure for both the unoperated lesions and the recurrent coarctation / restenosis at the site of the procedure. Restenosis is a common complication and is often associated with post stenotic aneurismal dilatation. Follow-up imaging to assess for post surgical success and assessment of potential late complications can be accomplished using various modalities.  Adequate visualization of the entire arch is needed.  Angiography remain the gold standard, however noninvasive imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is becoming more popular.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Approximately 20% of patients who undergo radiation treatment for cerebral glioma develop side effects from the treatment that mimic recurrent tumor, both clinically and radiologically.  Anatomic changes seen on both CT and MR images are insufficient to discriminate radiation-induced changes from tumor recurrence.  MR spectroscopy, PET, and SPECT imaging modalities have been proposed as possible tools for such differentiation.  Of these, MR spectroscopy holds much promise due to its inherent advantages: high-energy radiation is not used, and radio-labeled tracers are not required.  \n\nOn normal tissue, the most prominent peak is at around the 2.0 ppm (parts per million), the peak of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), which in past literature regarding MR spectroscopy is used as the normal neuronal marker, which is decreased in areas involved with tumor.  Both lipid and lactate peaks are seen around 1.0-1.5 ppm, if they are present.  The peak at the 3.0 ppm mark is the creatine (Cr), and the peak at the 3.2 ppm is the choline (Cho), which is usually elevated in areas involved with tumor.\n\nA study by Rabinov et al showed that in 16 of 17 biopsy locations in patients who has been previously treated with radiation therapy, they could be prospectively classified as either being predominantly tumor-involved or predominantly radiation effect based on a single criteria, that of the ratio of the peak area of choline at the biopsy site to that of the creatine at the corresponding normal site.  When this ratio was greater than 1.3, the biopsy site were all tumor-involved.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Holoprosencephaly is a congenital abnormality categorized as a disorder of diverticulation and cleavage.  The cerebrum (prosencephalon) does not form separate hemispheres and lobes.  One possible explanation is the interruption of lateral ventricular growth during the gestational 5th or 6th week.  This results in a continuum of findings that range from minor to severe. \n\nThe hallmark of the disorder is absence of the septum pellucidum.  With lobar holoprosencephaly, the mildest form, the interhemispheric fissure is formed except anteriorly where the grey and white matter are fused across the midline at the frontal lobe bases, the frontal horns are present but unseparated.  Also, the splenium, 3rd ventricle, occipital horns, and cerebral vasculature are normal.\n\n The most severe form is alobar holoprosencephaly where there is a large mono-ventricle emptying into the aqueduct of Sylvius, thalami are fused, and there is absence of the interhemispheric fissure, frontal horns, splenium, 3rd ventricle, and occipital horns.  The alobar type is associated with facial deformities. \n\nBetween the two extremes of holoprosencephaly lies semi-lobar holoprosencephaly.\n\nHoloprosencephaly is the only syndrome where the splenium and posterior corpus callosum may form with absence of the anterior corpus callosum (except for the rostrum). \n\nDisorders associated with holoprosencephaly are caudal agenesis, DiGeorge syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, Kallmann syndrome, maternal diabetes, and trisomies (13, 15, 18).\n\nSeptooptic dysplasia is considered in the spectrum of holoprosencephaly , albeit a milder form, and must be differentiated from lobar holoprosencephaly.  Septooptic dysplasia presents with the septum pellucidum absent or partially absent in association with small hypoplastic optic nerves and a small optic chiasm.  This results in dysplastic visual pathways.",

            "Discussion": "MRI is not used routinely in the evaluation of gout. However, when gouty tophi present as soft-tissue masses in the absence of articular disease, the tophi may be confused with a neoplastic process. In this instance, MRI evaluation is necessary. Tophaceous deposition should be considered in the differential diagnosis when a mass displays heterogeneous low to intermediate signal intensity on T1 and T2 weighting and a variable enhancement pattern, especially if multiple foci exist around the knee joint such as in this individual. Remarkably, the adjacent bone to these particular tophi did not show typical erosive changes, which is an unexpected finding in a patient with a chronic history of gout and knee pain. As such, needle biopsy was necessary to rule out a neoplastic and chronic infectious etiology."

            "Title": "Tophaceous gout",
            "Disease Discussion": "Associations/Predisposing  Factors: Nonmodifiable risk factors include age and sex. Gout prevalence increases in direct association with age; the increased longevity of populations in industrialized nations may contribute to a higher prevalence of gout through the disorder's association with aging-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome and hypertension, and treatments for these diseases such as thiazide diuretics for hypertension. Modifiable risk factors for gout include obesity, the use of certain medications, high purine intake, and consumption of purine-rich alcoholic beverages.\n\nCommon  Locations: acute gout is most often seen in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. Tophi are chalky deposits of sodium urate that are large enough to be seen on radiographs and may occur at virtually any site. The most common sites include the joints of the hands or feet.\n\nRadiology: MR imaging is not routinely used for evaluation of tophaceous gout. However, gout may present clinically in an atypical or confusing manner. A gouty tophus occasionally mimics an infectious or neoplastic process and MR imaging may be helpful under these circumstances. On magnetic resonance imaging, tophi usually have low signal intensity on both TI- and T2-weighted images and a variable enhancement pattern.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: Gout affects everyone differently. Some people have one episode and never have further progression of disease. Others have several episodes along with chronic pain and progressive joint damage. There is no cure for gout, but it can be controlled with medication. Proper treatment can help avoid attacks and long-term joint damage.",

It is a benign bone lesion, seen most commonly in the second and third decades, with a male to female predilection of approximately 2 to 1(3,4).  Of all the chondromas, periosteal chondroma accounts for less than 2% of cases(5).  The most common locations for this lesion are the metaphysis or diaphysis of the proximal humerus and distal femur(2-4).\nPeriosteal chondroma presents as a well demarcated, ossific mass in a juxtacortical position, with or without sclerotic borders and not continuous with the medullary cavity(2,4).  Periosteal chondroma exhibits a characteristic saucerization of the underlying cortex(3).  T1 weighted MRI imaging typically reveals a hypointense signal, and T2 weighted imaging shows a hyperintense signal.  In addition, MR imaging reveals that this lesion does not show soft tissue involvement or continuity with the medullary cavity(6).  \nHistologically, periosteal chondroma appears as a lobulated fibrocartilaginous matrix on low power.  Higher power reveals lobules of chondrocytes, sometimes showing atypia such as binucleation (2,4,7).  Ossification and calcification may also be present. \nSurgical excision is the treatment of choice(2,4,7), primarily due to the similarity to malignant lesions like osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. In addition, it may cause symptoms in the hand such as restricted range of motion or local pain and tenderness. Periosteal chondroma typically has a low rate of recurrence, particularly when excising the underlying periosteal tissue and any suspicious appearing cortex(2,3,8).",

Tendon degeneration is manifested by normal to increased tendon thickness with increased signal intensity in T1-weighted images that does not further increase in signal intensity on the T2-weighted images.  Complete tears may be diagnosed on MR imaging by identifying a fluid filled gap separating the tendon from its adjacent bony attachment site.\nMagnetic resonance imaging is useful in identifying high grade partial tears and complete tears that are unlikely to improve with rest and repeated steroid injections.  The lack of a significant abnormality involving the common extensor tendon on MR imaging may prompt consideration of an alternate diagnosis such as radial nerve entrapment which may mimic or accompany lateral epicondylitis.\nCoronal, STIR image of the elbow demonstrates high T2 signal within and surrounding the common extensor tendons consistent with lateral epicondylitis.",

The muscle groups that make up common extensor tendons that attach to the lateral epicondyle are the extensor carpi radialis brevis (ECRB), extensor digitorum communis, extensor carpi radialis longus, extensor carpi ulnaris, as well as the supinator muscle.  many proposed pathophysiologic causes including inflammatory processes of the radial humoral bursa, synovium, periostium, and the annular ligament. \n\tIn 1979, Nirchl and Petronne attributed the pathology of lateral epicondylitis to angiofibroblastic hyperplasia which is microscopic tearing with formation of reparative tissue.  This condition of microscopic tearing and repair response can lead to macroscopic tearing and structural failure of the origin of the ECRB muscle.\n\tThere can be numerous conditions that may lead to the above pathophysiology.  Conditions such as weak rotator cuff muscles leading to poor shoulder mechanics which can cause overuse of wrist extensors in a back swing motion.  Poor overall conditioning can also lead to improper wrist extension movements on long tennis or racquet ball matches.

A bit of controversy exists about not only the treatment of this condition, but also the exact pathophsiology, which is likely due to degeneration and/or tearing of the common extensor tendons. Lateral epicondylitis is reported more often in the industrial athlete and can be quite dedilitating. Because of the current controversy in regards to the pathophysiology, some debate exists on the proper treatment, which usually consists of a rehabilitation program, medical therapy, and surgical intervention, in combination or independently.",

            "Exam": "Physical Exam and Laboratory: \nNormal physical exam except for bilateral decreased range of motion of the hips and atalgic gait secondary to hip pain.  Laboratory studies showed mild macrocytic anemia and leukopenia.",
            "Findings": "Imaging Findings: Anteroposterior (AP) radiograph of the hips at presentation was normal and showed normal mineralization with no evidence of subluxation, dislocation, fractures, or osteoblastic/osteolytic changes.  Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of both the right and left hips demonstrated subchondral low signal intensity of the femoral head on coronal T1 imaging, best seen on the left, that becomes high signal intensity on a coronal STIR (fat suppressed) image.  There was also increased signal intensity of the femoral neck, particularly the lateral margin, on STIR imaging.  A subsequent AP hip radiograph 2 months after presentation shows new subchondral fracture lucencies in the right and left femoral heads and mild flattening of the left superior head along with bilateral preserved joint space.  A year after presentation, an AP hip radiograph showed an increase in collapse of the left femoral head and bilateral early degenerative change of the hips.",

The protocol specifies a number of short bursts of steroids over the course of the 130-week regimen, which has been halted in this patient.",
            "Discussion": "Discussion (include references): Avascular necrosis of the hip may be a difficult diagnosis to make when a patient first presents with hip pain or mild gait abnormalities.  Initial radiographs of the hips may no show no changes, as in this case.  Therefore, clinical suspicion should be high for this disorder in a patient whose history suggests the diagnosis.  Avascular necrosis is caused by a number of etiologies including femoral neck fracture, alcohol use, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, radiation treatment, and prolonged corticosteroid administration, as in this patient.  Steroids have been implicated in about 20 to 35 percent of cases.  The occurrence also appears to be directly related to the dosage level and duration of the medication.  In decreasing order of frequency, the most common locations of steroid-induced avasular osteonecrosis are the femoral head, humeral head, the distal end of the femur, and the proximal part of the tibia.  \n\nThe pathogenesis of steroid-induced osteonecrosis is unclear.  However several mechanisms have been proposed and include both mechanical and vascular etiologies.  Osteoporosis resulting in microfractures and later bone collapse is one mechanical theory.  Vascular compromise due to hyperviscosity, vasculitis, fat embolization, and compression from marrow accumulation of relatively inelastic fat cells are also other possible causes.\n  \nThe most common presenting symptom of avascular necrosis is pain.  Groin pain and less commonly thigh and buttock pain are seen in patients with femoral head involvement.  Patients may also complain of pain upon weight bearing.  Thirty to fifty percent have bilateral involvement.  Physical exam usually is nonspecific and may demonstrate limited range of motion particularly in abduction and internal rotation.\n\nRadiographic evaluation of a patient with suspected osteonecrosis includes an AP and frog-leg radiograph of both hips.  As mentioned above, the initial radiographs may not show any evidence of disease.  Subsequently, radiographic findings show sclerosis, indistinctive trabecular pattern, and patchy osteoporosis.  Progressive radiograph findings include a crescentic subchondral line indicative of subchondral collapse, segmental flattening of the femoral head, and ultimately joint space narrowing, acetabular degenerative changes, and collapse of the femoral head.\n\nMR imaging is the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis.  As with this patient, MR imaging showed evidence of osteonecrosis prior to the radiographs.  T1-weighted images typically show a line of low signal intensity, which corresponds to the presence of granulation tissue and sclerotic bone.  T2-weighted images typically demonstrate a double line sign, which consists of a narrower line of low signal intensity that corresponds to bone sclerosis and an inner zone of high signal intensity that corresponds to granulation tissue.   \n\nReferences\nLaPorte et al.  \u201cMultifocal Osteonecrosis.\u201d  Journal of Rheumatology.  25(10), Oct 1998, pp 1968-74. \nDonald Resnick.

            "Discussion": "Cerebral infarcts (strokes) are either ischemic or hemorrhagic in origin.  Ischemia is responsible for two-thirds of strokes, while hemorrhage causes about one-third.  CT or MRI provide a more definitive diagnosis than simply the history or clinical symptoms.  \n   Ischemic strokes can be caused by thrombosis or embolism.  Thrombosis more commonly occludes larger cerebral arteries, such as the ICAs, MCA or basilar artery, or the venous system.  These are generally preceded by TIAs, which give warning of an impending stroke and its affected territory.  The symptoms generally progress over minutes to hours.  Embolism usually occurs when thrombi pass to distal cerebral arteries from larger vessels such as the heart, aorta, or large cerebral arteries.  The symptoms at presentation usually do not progress further.   Hemorrhagic strokes can result in destruction or compression of brain tissue or vessels that then cause neurologic symptoms.  Some common causes are intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or subdural or epidural hemorrhage. \n   A patient who suffers from a cerebral infarct often has co-morbid conditions, broadly broken down into vascular, cardiac and hematologic disorders.  Common vascular disorders are atherosclerosis, inflammatory disorders (e.g., SLE, temporal arteritis) and migraines.  Arrhythmias, endocarditis, and rheumatic heart disease can lead to strokes.  Like this patient, sickle cell disease and hypercoagulable states can also result in strokes.\n   The middle cerebral artery is the most commonly occluded vessel in an ischemic stroke.  A stroke of the superior division will result in contralateral hemiparesis affecting the upper body (but not the legs), contralateral hemisensory deficit and if the dominant hemisphere is involved, Broca\u2019s aphasia.  An inferior division stroke may result in cortical sensory function impairment such as contralateral graphesthesia and stereognosis and disorders of spatial thought.  In the dominant hemisphere, Wernicke\u2019s aphasia may occur.  A stroke at the bifurcation or trifurcation will have superior and inferior divisional symptoms, plus homonymous hemianopia and global aphasia.  Finally, an occlusion of the stem of the MCA will logically be the most devastating, as it can cause hemiparesis of the entire contralateral side."

Vestibular Schwannomas comprise 8-10% of cranial tumors and occur at a rate of 0.78-1.15/100,000 in the United States.  They usually arise from the Obersteiner-Redlich transitional zone or line of the superior division of the vestibular nerve.  This line occurs 8-12 mm distal to the brain, is the site where Schwann and connective cells give way to glia (oligodendrocytes), and marks the true boundary between the central and peripheral nervous system.  They occur unilaterally in >95% of cases; bilateral masses are found in patients with neurofibromatosis Type 2, found on chromosome 22.\n\nThis mass is unusual in that one would expect extension of the mass to/from the IAC.  Therefore, CPA meningioma was originally thought to be a strong possibility.  However, the mass was confirmed by frozen section to exhibit pathology consistent with that of a vestibular Schwannoma.   \n\nThin slice gadolinium-enhanced MRI is the study of choice with 98% sensitivity and a false-positive rate of ~0%.

            "Title": "Quadriceps tendon rupture",
            "Disease Discussion": "Quadriceps tendon ruptures usually result from a rapid, strong eccentric contraction of the quadriceps muscle with the knee partially flexed, typically during a fall. This injury may also be seen after a direct blow to the quadriceps tendon. Ruptures are also known to occur spontaneously or after relatively trivial trauma, particulary in those with chronic conditions such as diabetes, chonic renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, or any condition requiring the use of long-term steroids. These tears most commonly occur at the tendinous insertion of the quadriceps to superior pole of the patella.  \n\nPatients usually present with knee pain, swelling and difficulty ambulating.  Physical exam with complete tears classically demonstrates suprapatellar swelling, a palpable defect in the suprapatellar region with tenderness, a low-riding patella, and decreased active range of motion and strength of knee extension.  Partial tears are often much more difficult to discern clinically and as such may be easily misdiagnosed as a \"knee sprain.\"\n\nImaging modalites such as plain radiography and MRI are often used to support the clinical findings.  Findings that suggest quadriceps tear on plain radiographs include suprapatellar soft tissue swelling and distortion of the typical fat planes, and patella baja (inferiorly positioned patella).  Due to the fact the injury commonly occurs at the tendinous insertion site at the patella, avulsion fractures of the patella may also be seen.  MRI demonstrates disruption of the normal low intensity quadriceps tendon on T2 weighted images, which is replaced by high intensity fluid signal secondary to inflammatory response and edema.  Ultrasound is another modality that may be used to demonstrate quadriceps tendon tears.  However, unlike MRI, ultrasound will not demonstrate secondary associated findings often seen in traumatic injuries to the knee such as ligamentous and osteochondral insults, and as such is used much less frequently.\n\nPartial tears are treated conservatively, typically with a 1-2 month peroid of immobilization in full knee extesion, followed by a course of physical therapy to restore range of motion and strength.  Complete tears are usually treated with early surgical intervention which again is followed by a course of immobilization and physical therapy.",

            "Discussion": "Tumors of the posterior fossa are the most common brain tumor in children.  They often present with symptoms of hydrocephalus (e.g. headache, vomiting and vertigo), cranial nerve or cerebellar symptoms (e.g. ataxia).  Obstruction of the fourth ventricle leading to hydrocephalus is not uncommon.  Cerebellar signs may be unilateral or axial depending on involvement of the vermis or a single hemisphere.  Astrocytomas and medulloblastomas are the most common posterior fossa tumors in children and present with similar frequency.  Ependymomas and hemangioblastomas are also commonly seen.\n\nAstrocytomas are common in children but are not uncommon in adults.  The incidence is similar between male and female, with perhaps a slight female predominance.  Pilocytic astrocytomas are, by definition, low-grade (WHO grade I) tumors.  They are well circumscribed lesions and may be cystic, solid or both.  The cystic form is seen in greater than 75% of lesions and has a classic appearance of a mural nodule in a cyst.  With MRI, the mural tumor appears iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hyperintense on T2-weight images.  The cyst wall does not consist of tumor cells and thus will not enhance on CT or MRI.  Complete resection is often curative, however solid tumors may not be as amenable to resection if the fourth ventricle is involved.\n\nMedulloblastoma, a primitive neuroectodermal tumor, is rare in adulthood, most commonly occurring between ages 5 and 15 with a 2:1 male predominance.  These highly malignant tumors usually arise in the midline in the posterior fossa (85%).  Medulloblastoma appears hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 and enhances with contrast.  It may appear well-circumscribed but is often found to be invasive at the margins on histology, often invades the fourth ventricle and will seed the subarachnoid space \u2013 necessitating surveillance of the spinal cord.  Death usually comes within months if not treated.  Resection, chemotherapy and radiation can extend life, with 60-75% survival at five years.\n\nHemangioblastomas are benign, low-grade (WHO grade I) tumors that are associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, but also occur in isolation.  They have a very similar appearance on MRI to astrocytomas, consisting of a cyst with mural module, but may also be solid or multiple with von Hippel-Lindau.  The mural nodule enhances and has classic flow and enhancement features on angiography.  As with pilocytic astrocytoma complete resection is often curative, however recurrence is not uncommon.\n\nEpendymomas most commonly arise in the floor of the fourth ventricle.  This is a malignant tumor that can spread throughout the ventricular system.  This mass can be differentiated from the others discussed here as it often has calcifications on CT.  Complete resection is rarely achievable, but these are usually radiosensitive.  On MRI, ependymomas may appear as multiple small cysts that enhance with contrast.\n\nMRI is the leading diagnostic and surveillance modality for posterior fossa tumors.  It provides greater detail of the lesion and has been shown to be more sensitive and specific than CT.  Although pediatric patients are more frequently sedated for MRI studies, there is no radiation and no iodinated contrast as with CT"

            "Disease Discussion": "Epidermoids, or cholesteatomas, are the most common congentital or embryonal CNS tumor.  Some sources state that they account for as little as 0.3% to as much as 1.8% of tumors.  During the third and fifth week of fetal development during the closure of the neural tube, epidermoids derive from the ectopic inclusions of epithelial cells.  If the cells have less cell differentiation, they result in dermoid tumors instead of epidermoid tumors.  The epithelial lesions grow at a rate similar to skin cells, and as a result, cause a very slow symptomatic onset.  \n\nThey usually arise in the suprasellar region, the skull base, brainstem, or cerebellopontine angle.  Recent literature suggests that epidermoid tumors have mostly been found at the cerebellopontine angle (37.3%) and in the parasellar region (30%), growing by spreading in the subarachnoid space of the basal cisterns.  They rarely develop into malignant processes.\n\nEpidermoids have a pearly appearance and are well circumscribed and encapsulated.  The epidermoids that are hypodense on CT may contain a soft, waxy material that consists of cholesterol crystals.  The hyperintense epidermoids on the other hand are mostly cystic and contain fluid of various colors.  Other sources suggest that the inner material is due to the progressive desquamation and breakdown of keratin.\n\nSymptoms associated with epidermoids usually appear after the second decade of life.  These symptoms are caused by displacement of adjacent vascular and neural structures.  The most frequent presenting symptom is trigeminal neuralgia.  Other symptoms that can occur are similar to those caused by acoustic neuroma like vertigo, asymmetric hearing loss, and unilateral tinnitus.  If the lesion gets very large, symptoms like headache, nausea, vomiting, diplopia, and ataxia, or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and hydrocephalus can develop.      \n\nOn imaging, most epidermoid tumors show a distinctive MRI appearance.  They are usually hypointense on T1 MRI and hyperintense on T2 MRI.  On T1, they can also show a characteristically marbled inner pattern.  Diffussion-weighted imaging can provide additional information by showing a clear, hyperintense signal.  On CT, an epidermoid can appear as a well-defined lobulated hypodense mass.\n\nTreatment is surgical resection with radical removal of the tumor capsule.",

            "Discussion": "Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) is a transmissible neurodegenerative spongiform encephalopathy, that is progressive and ultimately fatal, with no effective treatment at the present time. It is classified as a prion disease, which is an abnormal conformation of a host glycoprotein, that replicates in a self-perpetuating cycle of abnormal proteins and amyloid plaques. CJD has a long incubation period, with most cases presenting in the sixth or seventh decade of life. CJD has a mean onset of 62 years, with reports of cases ranging from 17 to 83 years of age. The incidence is approximately 1 case per million internationally and in the United States, with some Libyan Jewish populations and a few populations in rural areas of Slovakia, having 60-100 times this rate of familial CJD. \n\nThere are three classifications of CJD: sporadic (spontaneous mutation), variant (infectious), and familial. Familial CJD accounts for about 10% of all cases, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  The mean duration after symptoms present is 8 months for the sporadic form, 16 months for variant, and 26 months for familial form. \n\nCJD is characterized by a rapidly progressive cognitive imparement, behavorial abnormalities, myoclonic jerks, higher cortical dysfunction and visual cortical abnormalities, cerebellar dysfunction, and pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. These signs and symptoms steadily increase, with death primarily occurring secondary to bronchopneumonia, due to overall disability and a bed-ridden state.\n\nTesting for CJD is difficult at best, and in its early stages can present like many different disease processes, with a definitive diagnosis being accomplished only after a biopsy of brain tissue. Sixty percent of patients show characteristic EEG changes of periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) on a slow and low-voltage background.  However, EEG has a low specificity and a sensitivity of only 50.0%. Testing for brain specific proteins such as the 14-3-3 protein and the neuron-specific enolase also supports a diagnoses of CJD, but even though they are more specific than EEG, they have a sensitivity of 84.0% and\n73.3% respectfully.\n\nPET scanning may show regional hypometabolism of glucose.\n\nThe most sensitive test to date is the MRI diffusion weighted images (DWI), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 92.3% and 93.8 respectfully. DWI is more sensitive than both T2I and FLAIR. DWI shows symmetrical high intensity lesions in the striatum (caudate and putamen), the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, and cerebral cortical lesions. These findings were identifiable before PSWC\u2019s on EEG , and before the final stages of the disease, which results in brain atrophy.  \n\nTreatment at this time is symptomatic and palliative, but a number of experimental interventions are being tested, such as antimalarial quinacrine, chlorpromazine, and pentosan polysulphate, which prevent prion conversion and production, and an immunization that reduces the cerebral amyloid accumulation. \n\nFinally, as seen with this patient, CJD must always be in a differential for rapid dementia or for patients experiencing changes in mood, ataxia, and visual disturbances.\n\nToday, we can only ease the suffering of CJD, but on the horizon a treatment may be near, and someday we can offer a real cure and a way to stop this deadly prion disease."

            "Disease Discussion": "Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD) is a neurodegenerative spongiform encephalopathy, that is progressive, transmissible, and ultimately fatal, with no effective treatment at the present time. It is classified as a prion disease, which is an abnormal conformation of a host glycoprotein, that replicates in a self-perpetuating cycle of abnormal proteins and amyloid plaques. CJD has a long incubation period, with most cases presenting in the sixth or seventh decade of life. CJD has a mean onset of 62 years, with reports of cases ranging from 17 to 83 years of age. \n\nThe incidence is approximately 1 case per million internationally and in the United States, with some Libyan Jewish populations and a few populations in rural areas of Slovakia, having 60-100 times the rate of familial CJD.\n\nThere are three classifications of CJD: sporadic (spontaneous mutation), variant (infectious), and familial. Familial CJD accounts for about 10% of all cases, and inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.  The mean duration after symptoms present is 8 months for the sporadic form, 16 months for variant, and 26 months for familial form. \n\nCJD is characterized by a rapidly progressive cognitive imparement, behavorial abnormalities, myoclonic jerks, higher cortical and cortical visual abnormalities, cerebellar dysfunction, and pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs. These signs and symptoms steadily increase, with death primarily occurring due to bronchopneumonia, due to a bed-ridden state.\n\nTesting for CJD is difficult at best, and in its early stages can present like many different disease processes, with a definitive diagnosis being accomplished only after a biopsy of brain tissue. Sixty percent of patients show characteristic EEG changes of periodic sharp wave complexes (PSWCs) on a slow and low-voltage background, but EEG has a low specificity and a sensitivity of only 50.0%. Testing for brain specific proteins such as the 14-3-3 protein and the neuron-specific enolase also supports a diagnoses of CJD, but even though they are more specific than EEG, only have a sensitivity of 84.0% and 73.3% respectfully. \n\nPET scanning may show regional hypometabolism of glucose. \n\nThe most sensitive test to date is the MRI diffusion weighted images (DWI), which has a sensitivity and specificity of 92.3% and 93.8 respectfully. DWI is more sensitive than both T2I and FLAIR. DWI shows symmetrical high intensity lesions in the striatum (caudate and putamen), the dorsomedial thalamic nuclei, and cerebral cortical lesions. These findings were identifiable before PSWC\u2019s on EEG , and before the final stages of the disease, which results in brain atrophy.  \n\nTreatment at this time is symptomatic and palliative, but a number of experimental interventions are being tested, such as antimalarial quinacrine, chlorpromazine, and pentosan polysulphate, which prevent prion conversion and production, and an immunization that reduces the cerebral amyloid accumulation. \n\nFinally, as seen with this patient, CJD must always be in a differential for rapid dementia or for patients experiencing changes in mood, ataxia, and visual disturbances. Today, we can only ease the suffering of CJD, but on the horizon a treatment may be near, and someday we can offer a real cure and a way to stop this deadly prion disease.",

            "Title": "Monostotic Fibrous Dysplasia",
            "Disease Discussion": "Fibrous dysplasia is a skeletal developmental anomaly of the bone-forming mesenchyme that manifests as a defect in osteoblastic differentiation and maturation. It is a nonhereditary disorder of unknown cause. \n\nIn fibrous dysplasia, the medullary bone is replaced by fibrous tissue, which appears radiolucent on radiographs, with the classically described ground-glass appearance. Trabeculae of woven bone contain fluid-filled cysts that are embedded largely in collagenous fibrous matrix, which contributes to the generalized hazy appearance of the bone. Fibrous dysplasia was found to affect males and females equally, but it was 50% more prevalent in the maxilla. \n\nThe following 4 disease patterns are recognized: Monostotic form, Polyostotic form, Craniofacial form and Cherubism\n\nMonostotic Fibrous Dysplasia. Approximately 70-80% of fibrous dysplasias are monostotic. This form most frequently occurs in the rib (28%), femur (23%), tibia or craniofacial bones (10-25%), humerus, and vertebrae, in decreasing order of frequency.\n\nThis form may present with pain or a pathologic fracture in patients aged 10-70 years, but this form most frequently occurs in those aged 10-30 years. The degree of bone deformity of the monostotic form is relatively less severe than that of the polyostotic type. No clearly documented evidence supports conversion of the monostotic form to the polyostotic form.\n\nFibrous dysplasia may be associated with endocrinopathies in 2-3% of cases; these include precocious puberty in girls, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, acromegaly, diabetes mellitus, and Cushing syndrome. McCune-Albright syndrome may be associated with hyperthyroidism and, hence, exophthalmos.\n\nRadiological findings:\nThe usual appearance of fibrous dysplasia includes a lucent lesion in the diaphysis or metaphysis, with endosteal scalloping and with or without bone expansion and the absence of periosteal reaction. Usually, the matrix of the lucency is smooth and relatively homogeneous; classically, this finding is described as a ground-glass appearance. Irregular areas of sclerosis may be present with or without calcification. The lucent lesion has a thick sclerotic border and is called the rind sign.\n\nFollow-up:\nMalignant degeneration, Estimated frequency is 0.4-1%.\nThe interval from the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia to the development of malignancy varies and is usually years or decades.\nMost often, skull and facial bones undergo malignant change in monostotic disease, whereas femoral and facial bones undergo malignant change in polyostotic disease.\nOsteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma are the most common tumors. Chondrosarcomas occur less frequently.\nRadiographic features suggestive of malignant degeneration include a rapid increase in the size of the lesion and a change from a previously mineralized bony lesion to a lytic lesion. Clinical findings of increasing pain and an enlarging soft-tissue mass suggest malignant change.\n\nMetabolic changes, Hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia have been noted in patients with fibrous dysplasia. \nOne hypothesis to explain the associated metabolic disorder suggests that lesions such as fibrous dysplasia synthesize phosphaturic hormone.",

            "Discussion": "AVN most often occurs during the fourth or fifth decade of life and is bilateral in 55% of cases.  The etiology for AVN of the femoral heads is vast and includes trauma, hemoglobinopathies, Caisson disease, local infiltrative diseases such as Gaucher disease, hypercortisolism, alcohol, pancreatitis, renal failure, cigarteet smoking, collagen vascular diseasese, congenital diseases such as SCFE and Legg-CalveP-Perthe, Fabry, giant cell arteritis, gout, hemodialysis, HLD, hyperparathyroidism, pregnancy, SLE, and idiopathic. The most common cause of bilateral AVN is steroid use, even for short periods. Our patient had a history of stage I sarcoid disease that was untreated.  The etiology of this patient's bilateral AVN of the femoral head is unclear.  There is no case report of a link between sarcoid and AVN. The patient did however have chronic recurrent bouts of sinusitis that required steroids.  He received both fluticasone and oral prednisone for short periods during these recurrent attacks of sinusitis.  This appears to be one possible etiology of his AVN."

Patients who had one or more typical lesions for MS on the MRI of the brain had 56% risk, and those without such lesions had 22% risk.  Among the patients with no typical MS lesions on the MRI of the brain, male gender, optic disc swelling, perpapillary hemorrhages, and retinal exudates were associated with a lower risk of developing MS.

            "Disease Discussion": "The first report of Renal Oncocytoma occured in 1942, but it wasn't until 1976 that it was established as a clinical entity.  Between 3% and 7% of renal masses are oncocytomas.  Oncocytomas, much like renal cell carcinomas, are often found incidentally with no symptoms being present at the time of diagnosis.  This tumor is classified as benign, but clinically and radiologically is very difficult to differentiate from renal cell carcinoma.  Grossly the tumor is brown or tan and appears encapsulated.  Often there is a central scar, but there is an absence of hemorrhage and necrosis.\n\nRadiologically these tumors are evaluated the same way as renal cell.  On ultrasound the oncocytoma is indistinguishable from renal cell.  Typical features on CT include a central, stellate pattern with low attentuation.  Additionally the tumor appears very homogenous.  With angiography oncocytomas have four typical signs: lucent rim, homogenous capillary nephrogram phase, absence of neoplastic vessels, and feeding arteries with a spoked wheel appearance.  While these have been used as predictors of oncocytoma, they have shown poor predictive value in differentiating oncocytoms from renal cell.  MRI is currently being evaluated for its ability to diagnose oncocytoma.  Characteristics indicative of this tumor on MR include low intensity homogenous mass on T1 that shows increased intensity on T2 with a capsule, central scar or stellate pattern and no hemorrhage or necrosis. \n\nOncocytomas are very difficult to differentiate from renal cell carcinoma both clincally and radiologically and the use of renal biposy is not recommended due to the similar histological appearance of the two entities in certain situations.  As a result they are treated surgically.  Whether this is done with a partial or complete nephrectomy is often determined by the patient's clinical picture.",

The immune system of women with intact implants is exposed to variable amounts of silicone soon after augmentation.  Saline is resorbed into the lymphatics and is undetectable.\n\nImplants are foreign bodies which become walled off by the formation of a fibrous capsule.  Such a capsule (bands of fibrous tissue) forms in all women with implants.  The capsule may remain soft or harden and contract around the implant.  As encapsulation occurs, the implants may become hard and immobile.  Mammographic displaced implant views may be difficult to obtain.  Encapsulation becomes apparent mammographically as the implants become round on MLO views. \n\nIntracapsular rupture occurs when the implant ruptures and the silicone is free within the fibrous capsule surrounding the implant.  Intracapsular rupture is difficult to identify mammographically.  \u201cLinguini sign\u201d describes the MRI findings of the low T2 signal redundant implant shell with high T2 fluid signal within and surroundng the shell, contained within the fibrous capsule.\n\nExtracapsular rupture occurs when silicone is free and found outside the implant and capsule.  Silicone can often be seen migrating to the axillary lymph nodes.  No definitive proof of a relationship between silicone and autoimmune disorders or cancer has been identified.  \n\nWhen a saline implant ruptures, the saline is resorbed into the lymphatics resulting in decreased breast size.  Intra- vs extracapsular rupture is difficult to distinguish as all extra-implant saline is resorbed.  The implant shell becomes redundant, best seen on MRI imaging when compared to the opposite implant.",

            "Disease Discussion": "The most common extraaxial neoplasm of the brain, meningiomas, often affect middle-aged women.  They account for 15-20% of all primary brain tumors. They are most commonly found in the parasagittal dura, convexities, sphenoid wing, cerebellopontine angle cistern, and olfactory groove.  Up to 90% are supratentorial, and 1% occur outside the CNS (presumably due to arachnoid rests).  Less than 10% cause symptoms, with the majority discovered incidentally or at autopsy or on brain imaging.\n\nOn CT, they are typically hyperdense, with up to 20% demonstrating calcification.  On MR, they are typically well-circumscribed and iso- to hypointense on T1, iso- to hyperintense on T2, and strongly enhancing.  A dural tail is seen in up to 72%, which is thought to represent a neoplastic infiltration or a reactive fibrovascular proliferation of the meninges.  This finding is suggestive but not specific, however.  Similarly, a distinct cleft of arachnoid with trapped CSF and vessels is common.  Meningiomas typically take one of two forms, either \u201cglobose\u201d (spherical) or \u201cen plaque\u201d (flat).\n\nMeningiomas may encase and narrow vessels, and incite a varying amount of edema, depending on location (cerebral cortical lesions have more edema, basal cisterns \u2013 less).  Bony changes may be hyperostotic or osteolytic, mimicking Paget\u2019s or fibrous dysplasia.  On angiography, the \u201cin-law\u201d sign has been described (coming early and staying late) with an early blush and delayed washout.  Due to their vascularity, preoperative embolization can be performed (particularly at the skull base, where the lesions may be unresectable).\n\nMalignant meningiomas, a rare variant, demonstrate rapid growth or intraparenchymal invasion.  These are associated with a higher rate of recurrence \u2013 75%, versus a recurrence rate of 3-7% for benign meningiomas.",

(1)\n\nAccording to current orthopedic surgery literature, meniscus tears known to be suitable for repair with high expectation for success are traumatic lesions within the vascular zone in which the peripheral circumferential fibers remain intact and there is minimal damage to the meniscus body. Tears should generally be greater than 8mm, as shorter tears are more likely to heal spontaneously and even if they persist are likely to be asymptomatic. The most common tear types that fit these criteria: peripheral or near peripheral, vertical, or longitudinal tears.  Those tears that are questionable in terms of being surgical candidates are those which are in avascular portion of the meniscus or when vascularity is in question, complete radial tears at the meniscosynovial junction, and tears that result in extensive damage to the body.

It was found in 2 out of 1,287 patients (0.15%) in one series in a single institution who underwent MR imaging of the knee.  Prior to MR imaging, fluoroscopy was used to help distinguish between the two.  Arthrotomy or arthroscopy is confirmatory, and it remains the gold standard test.\n\nMeniscal ossicles have been shown to be more prevalent in young male patients.  They have also been associated with meniscal tears, and some believe them to be a factor in causing meniscal tears.  Clinically, patients can be asymptomatic or have symptoms similar to that of meniscal tears (pain, clicking, or locking).  At MR imaging, meniscal ossicles characteristically are located in the posterior horns of the medial menisci.  Signal characteristics are that of bone: low T1/T2 signal rim equal to that of cortical bone with marrow signal (high on T1 and T2 fast-spin echo sequences) within, which appropriately decreases in signal on fat-saturation images like marrow fat.  Pathologically, the ossicles consist of bone marrow and cancellous bone contained by cortex covered with cartilage.\n\nOrigin or etiology of meniscal ossicles in humans are unknown.  They have been found in other species such as rats and other rodents as a normal finding.  Two hypotheses exist, one considering these as a congenital/developmental entities, and the other believing that these are post-traumatic lesions.\n\nExcision of the ossicle at arthroscopic examination is indicated for symptomatic patients.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Pigmented villonodular synovitis (PVNS) was first described by Jaffe in 1941(1). The etiology of the disease is not well defined. Some investigators favor an inflammatory pathogenesis while others consider PVNS a form of benign neoplasm. Other etiologies-metabolic, traumatic, and genetic-have also been considered.  Although both polyclonal & monoclonal lineages of synovial cells have been demonstrated, current opinion favors a neoplastic process (2). \n\nA 1980 epidemiologic study of 166 patients reported the incidence of this tumor as 1.8-2 per million per year (3). There appears to be no sex predilection. The most common sites of involvement are the knee, hip, ankle, shoulder, & elbow in decreasing order of frequency (4).  \n\nWhen the knee is involved symptoms are typically non-specific with pain, effusion, & warmth being the most frequently reported. Range of motion becomes limited as the mass occupies more space. Studies are generally normal with the exception of gross blood upon aspiration of the joint space (4).\n\nMR imaging is the primary modality for evaluating PVNS. Radiographs are used in the initial evaluation and are helpful in delineating osseous erosions. Synovial chondromatosis and PVNS are the two main differentials to consider when radiographs show well mineralized bones and focal sites of erosion. Absence of calcifications and characteristic MR imaging findings, however, are more suggestive of PVNS. On MR imaging PVNS appears as an intra-articular soft tissue mass (or masses) and can exhibit variable signal intensity depending on the amount of hemosiderin deposition, lipid filled macrophages, & fibrosis (4). Villous or cystic low-signal-intensity masses combined with a \u201cblooming\u201d artifact on the gradient-recalled echo sequence are nearly pathognomonic for PVNS. After contrast, PVNS will enhance. In the absence of typical MR findings, CT-guided biopsy should be considered. At histology, the presence of mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells, and hemosiderin deposition are consistent with the diagnosis of PVNS (4). \n\nThe traditional treatment of PVNS is total synovectomy (5). Post-surgical adjuvant radiation, either external beam or by intra-articular injection, has shown promise in some small case series (6,7). The ultimate goal of treatment is to remove the mass and prevent recurrence while preserving maximum joint function. Severe progression of the disease can lead to joint destruction and a need for arthrodesis.",

            "Discussion": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a multifocal disease with a complex pathogenesis that includes inflammation and potentially disabling focal lesions that disseminate throughout the central nervous system.  It is the most common primary myelin disorder, with an estimated patient prevalence of 250,000 to 350,000 in the United States.  Eighty percent of patients have relapsing-remitting MS, and the minority of patients has primary progressive MS.  This subtype of MS usually begins in the second or third decade of life and has a female predominance of approximately 2:1.  The prevalence is highest in northern Europe, however, the occurrence of rapid shifts in the incidence of MS have been reported in recent studies.\nThe pathogenesis of MS remains unclear today.  However, a multifactorial pathogenetic mechanism has been postulated given the heterogeneity of clinical, genetic, and radiological studies of MS.  The pathological hallmark of chronic MS is the demyelinated plaque, which consisted of a well-demarcated hypocellular area characterized by the loss of myelin, relative preservation of axons, and the formation of astrocytic scars.  Lesions have a predilection for the optic nerves, periventreicular white matter, brain stem, cerebellum, and spinal cord white matter.  Lesions are usually round or ovoid, thought they may also have finger-like extensions along the path of small or medium-sized blood vessels (Dawson\u2019s fingers).\n     \tThe diagnosis of multiple sclerosis is based on established clinical, laboratory and radiological findings.  Patients with the relapsing forms of multiple sclerosis usually present with sensory disturbances, unilateral optic neuritis, diplopia, limb weakness, gait ataxia, and neurogenic bladder and bowel.  Prominent cortical signs and extrapyamidal phenomena can also present but are rarely predominant features of the clinical presentation.  Laboratory workup typically includes a cerebrospinal fluid analysis, which often shows increased intrathecal synthesis of immunoglobulins of restricted specificity (oligoclonal bands of IgG) with moderate lymphocytic pleocytosis.  Cole and colleagues have suggested that the presence of oligoclonal bands in cerebrospinal fluid slightly increases the risk of recurrent disease.\n     \tMRI is the preferred imaging modality to study suspected MS as it depicts the frequency, shape, and location of the characteristic MS lesions.  These lesions have discrete foci with well-defined margins that are commonly located in a periventricular location, in the deep white matter, adjacent to the atria, occipital horns, and the body of the lateral ventricles.  T2-weighted images reflect a broad spectrum of pathological changes, including inflammation, edema, demyelination, gliosis, and axonal loss.  Many of the hyperintense T2-weighted lesions have little clinical significance, as they are more likely to be chronic MS lesions.  Hence, there is no correlation with the number of brain lesions detected with a T2-weighted sequence and the patient\u2019s level of functional disability.  Studies have shown that fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences are superior to T2-weighted images for detecting MS brain lesions as it can detect many cortical and juxtacortial lesions in MS, which may present in secondary progressive disease and often missed by other sequences.  Furthermore, gadolinium-DTPA injection, a paramagnetic contrast agent that crosses only disrupted blood-brain-barrier, may demonstrate foci of demyelination."

T2-weighted images reflect a broad spectrum of pathological changes, including inflammation, edema, demyelination, gliosis, and axonal loss.  Many of the hyperintense T2-weighted lesions have little clinical significance, as they are more likely to be chronic MS lesions.  Hence, there is no correlation with the number of brain lesions detected with a T2-weighted sequence and the patient\u2019s level of functional disability.  Studies have shown that fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences are superior to T2-weighted images for detecting MS brain lesions as it can detect many cortical and juxtacortial lesions in MS, which may present in secondary progressive disease and often missed by other sequences.  Furthermore, gadolinium-DTPA injection, a paramagnetic contrast agent that crosses only disrupted blood-brain-barrier, may demonstrate foci of demyelination.",

            "Title": "Autosomal Dominant \"Adult\" Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD)",
            "Disease Discussion": "BACKGROUND: \nThe autosomal dominant form of polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is an important cause of renal failure, accounting for 10% to 15% of patients who receive hemodialysis. Its incidence is approximately 1 in 500 to 1000, and approximately 500,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease. \n\nTwo genes for ADPKD have been localized, PKD1 on chromosome 16 and PKD2 on chromosome 4. A third but rare genetic locus, PKD3, is thought to exist but has not yet been identified. The trait theoretically has a 100% penetrance, and on average, because it is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, 50% of an affected individual\u2019s offspring will likewise be affected. Ninety-six percent of affected persons will manifest the disease clinically by age 90 years.\n\nETIOLOGY:\nOne theory suggests that a defect in the basement membrane of the tubules accounts for cyst development.  A 2nd theory holds that epithelial hyperplasia is an integral part of cyst formation. A 3rd theory postulates a defect in one of the proteins of the supportive extracellular connective tissue matrix.  A 4th theory involves the location of Na+ -K+ -ATPase in the cystic epitheliumEach theory has supportive findings.  However, it appears that tubular epithelial cell hyperplasia is the major component of cyst development.\n\nGENETICS: \nTwo genes have been identified as the culprits for ADPKD: the polycystic kidney disease (PKD1) gene localized on the short arm of chromosome 16, which accounts for approximately 85% to 90% of cases, and the PKD2 gene localized to chromosome 4, which accounts for approximately 5% to 10% of cases. The presence of a third locus (PKD3) is now accepted as the cause of disease in a very small percentage of patients.   Those with the PKD2 defect usually typically  have a later onset of clinical symptoms and a slower progression of disease. In addition, Bear, et al, suggested that the disease in general is more severe and manifests earlier when it is inherited from the mother rather than from the father.\n\nCLINICAL FEATURES:\nTypically, symptoms or signs first occur between the ages of 30 and 50 years. These include microscopic and gross hematuria, flank pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and renal colic secondary either to clots or stone and hypertension. Microscopic or gross hematuria is seen in 50% of patients, and in 19% to 35% it is the presenting symptom.  However, as blood pressure screening has become more widespread, hypertension more than hematuria has become the principal form of presentation.  In children who present after 1 year of age, the principal signs and symptoms are related to hypertension, proteinuria, and/or hematuria.  Neonates present mostly on the basis of renomegaly. When the disease is severe, stillbirth or significant respiratory distress can occur.\n\nApproximately 10% to 40% of patients have berry aneurysms, and approximately 9% of these patients die because of subarachnoid hemorrhages.\n\nOther abnormalities associated with ADPKD are mitral valve prolapse and colonic diverticulosis.\n\nHISTOPATHOLOGY:\nThe renal cysts range from a few millimeters to a few centimeters in diameter and appear diffusely throughout the cortex and medulla with communications at various points along the nephron.  Epithelial hyperplasia or even adenoma formation in the cyst wall is common, and the basement membrane of the wall is thickened. Arteriosclerosis is present in more than 70% of patients with preterminal or terminal renal failure, and interstitial fibrosis, with or without infiltrates, is common. This fibrosis may be secondary to infection or to an inflammatory reaction set off by spontaneously rupturing cysts.\n\nASSOCIATION WITH RENAL CELL CARCINOMA (RCC):\nThe incidence of RCC in patients with ADPKD is no higher than that in the general population.\n\nEVALUATION:\nTo make the diagnosis, it is important to have a history of the patient\u2019s family spanning at least three generations.  When there is no family history to support a diagnosis of ADPKD, a presumptive diagnosis can be made if bilateral renal cysts are present and two or more of the following symptoms are present as well: bilateral renal enlargement; three or more hepatic cysts; cerebral artery aneurysm; and a solitary cyst of the arachnoid, pineal gland, pancreas, or spleen.\n\nIn adults, intravenous urography usually reveals bilateral renal enlargement, calyceal distortion, and a bubble or Swiss cheese appearance in the nephrogram phase. A CT scan or MRI may is superior to sonography for detecting cysts in organs other than the kidney. CT is helpful in making the diagnosis of hemorrhage within a cyst. More acute hemorrhage has a higher density (50 to 90 Hounsfield units [HU]) than old hemorrhage. MRI also may be helpful, particularly in patients with compromised renal function, because no contrast agent is needed\n\nEXAMINATION OF FAMILY MEMBERS AND GENETIC COUNSELING\nBecause ADPKD is an autosomal dominant condition, 50% of the children of affected adults will also be affected. Therefore, when the disease is diagnosed, the patient\u2019s children should be examined by ultrasound. Before 1970, diagnosis of ADPKD before the age of 25 years was rare. With ultrasound, the possibility of making the diagnosis in affected individuals before this age is at least 85%. When genetic studies are used, the diagnostic accuracy approaches 100%.\n\nTREATMENT AND PROGNOSIS\nMore than 60% of patients with ADPKD who do not yet have renal impairment have hypertension, which can worsen renal function, cause cardiac disease, and predispose the patient to intracranial hemorrhage. The complications of ADPKD can be reduced significantly by controlling the blood pressure.\n\nAcute pain may be secondary to infection or hemorrhage into a cyst or to subcapsular bleeding. Chronic loin pain requiring narcotics is probably related to distention of cysts and the renal capsule. Some have proposed an operation that involves unroofing the cysts to relieve the pain. \n\nThe rate of renal deterioration seems to correlate with the rate of cyst growth.  Churchill, et al, calculated that patients with sonographically identifiable ADPKD have a 2% chance of developing end-stage renal failure by age 40 years, a 23% chance by age 50, and a 48% chance by age 73.\n\nEMERGING THERAPEUTICS:\nBecause polycystic kidney disease entities represents hyperplastic cystic conditions, Grantham suggested that it is time to treat polycystic kidney diseases like the neoplastic disorders they are. One such method would be to block the action of growth factors or their receptors. Another would be to consider chemotherapeutic agents.",

Peak incidence is in the fifth to seventh decades.  Most meningiomas arise from arachnoid caps cells in the arachnoid granulations.  A lesser number arise from dural fibroblasts.\n\nMeningiomas may be completely asymptomatic (>90%) or may present with hydrocephalus, seizures, focal neurological deficits, headaches, and neuropathies.  Symptoms usually depend on the location of the lesion.  90% are supratentorial. Common locations include the parasagital region, cerebral convexities and sphenoid ridge.  Others include the olfactory groove and the parasellar region.\n\nMeningiomas enhance uniformly on CT and are usually slightly hyperdense compared to surrounding brain on NCECT.  About one-quarter calcify.  With MRI, meningiomas are usually isointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, but can vary.  Homogeneous enhacement after gadolinium occurs as well.  Edema-like changes in the surrounding whate matter can occur and may persist for some time after removal of the mass.

            "Disease Discussion": "Avascular necrosis of the hip may be a difficult diagnosis to make when a patient first presents with hip pain or mild gait abnormalities.  Initial radiographs of the hips may not show any changes, as in this case.  Therefore, clinical suspicion should be high for this disorder in a patient whose history suggests the diagnosis.  Avascular necrosis is caused by a number of etiologies including femoral neck fracture, alcohol use, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, radiation treatment, and prolonged corticosteroid administration, as in this patient.  Steroids have been implicated in about 20 to 35 percent of cases.  The occurrence also appears to be directly related to the dosage level and duration of the medication.  In decreasing order of frequency, the most common locations of steroid-induced avasular osteonecrosis are the femoral head, humeral head, the distal end of the femur, and the proximal part of the tibia.  \n\nThe pathogenesis of steroid-induced osteonecrosis is unclear.  However several mechanisms have been proposed and include both mechanical and vascular etiologies.  Osteoporosis resulting in microfractures and later bone collapse is one mechanical theory.  Vascular compromise due to hyperviscosity, vasculitis, fat embolization, and compression from marrow accumulation of relatively inelastic fat cells are also other possible causes.\n  \nThe most common presenting symptom of avascular necrosis is pain.  Groin pain and less commonly thigh and buttock pain are seen in patients with femoral head involvement.  Patients may also complain of pain upon weight bearing.  Thirty to fifty percent have bilateral involvement.  Physical exam usually is nonspecific and may demonstrate limited range of motion particularly in abduction and internal rotation.\n\nRadiographic evaluation of a patient with suspected osteonecrosis includes an AP and frog-leg radiograph of both hips.  As mentioned above, the initial radiographs may not show any evidence of disease.  Subsequently, radiographic findings show sclerosis, indistinctive trabecular pattern, and patchy osteoporosis.  Progressive radiograph findings include a crescentic subchondral line indicative of subchondral collapse, segmental flattening of the femoral head, and ultimately joint space narrowing, acetabular degenerative changes, and collapse of the femoral head.\n\nMR imaging is the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis.  As with this patient, MR imaging showed evidence of osteonecrosis prior to the radiographs.  T1-weighted images typically show a line of low signal intensity, which corresponds to the presence of granulation tissue and sclerotic bone.  T2-weighted images typically demonstrate a double line sign, which consists of a narrower line of low signal intensity that corresponds to bone sclerosis and an inner zone of high signal intensity that corresponds to granulation tissue.   \n\nReferences\nLaPorte et al.  \u201cMultifocal Osteonecrosis.\u201d  Journal of Rheumatology.  25(10), Oct 1998, pp 1968-74. \nDonald Resnick.

This entity should not be confused with osteonecrosis secondary to steroid use, alcoholism, etc.  SONK occurs spontaneously, but likely is the result of microtrauma and/or vascular comprimise.\n\nThe clinical presentation is very similar to more common entities such as degenerative joint disease or meniscal degeneration.  Patients commonly present with acute medial joint pain.\n\nSONK typically involves the medial femoral condyle, but can affect the lateral femoral condyle or the tibial plateaus.  SONK of the tibial plateau may be associated with meniscal injury.\n\nPlain radiographs often are normal, but may demonstrate a spectrum of findings such as flattening of the articular surface, subchondral lucency, an/or sclerosis.  SONK shows increased uptake on nuclear bone scan.  MR findings consist of long T2 signal associated with edema and necrosis.  The overlying articular cartilage may also be abnormal.\n\nTreatment options range from conservative to surgical.  Surgical treatments include core decompression, drilling, and total knee arthroplasty.\n\n\n\n*****Reviewed by MAJ Alex Freitas MC, Chief of Musculoskeletal Radiology, TAMC",

            "Title": "Tethered spinal cord with terminal spinal lipoma.",
            "Disease Discussion": "Early in embryogenesis, the spinal cord extends to the caudal end of the spinal canal.  At that time, each neural segment is at the exact same level as the corresponding segment of the spinal canal.  Each nerve root extends directly laterally to its neural foramen.  As the embryo matures, the most distal portion of the cord undergoes a process known as retrogressive differentiation.  In this process, the most distal fibers degenerate and elongate.  At the same time, the vertebral bodies are growing more quickly than the cord.  This combination of factors results in a relative ascent of the spinal cord within the spinal canal.  The precise level of the conus medullaris within the spinal canal at the time of birth is debated.  However, it has been established that the conus is usually positioned at the L1-L2 level by the age of 3 months.  The conus is generally considered abnormal if it extends below the bottom of L2.\n\nIn some patients, the process of retrogressive differentiation goes awry.  In these patients the conus medullaris remains below the bottom of L2.  As a consequence, the distal spinal cord is stretched and does not function normally.  \n\nPatients with tethered spinal cords can present at any age.  All patients tend to suffer from difficulty with locomotion, ranging from muscle stiffness to actual weakness.  All patients have abnormal lower extremity reflexes.  The patients can also exhibit bladder dysfunction, sensory changes, and orthopedic deformities of the lower extremities (most commonly club foot).  Back pain and radiculopathy are also common complaints; in fact,  most adults with tethered cords present with radiculopathy.\n\nThe diagnosis of a tethered spinal cord is easily made with MR.  The major findings are the conus medullaris ending below the bottom of L2 and a thickened filum terminale.  The normal filum terminale measures less than or equal to 2 mm in diameter at the L5- S1 level.  A word of caution should be issued concerning identification of the level of the conus medullaris.  On sagittal images, it is sometimes difficult to differentiate the bottom of the spinal cord from the proximal cauda equina.  Therefore, it is advisable to obtain axial, T1-weighted images if there is any question whatsoever about the level of the conus.  It should be noted that approximately 25% of patients with tethering of the spinal cord will have a mild dilatation of the central canal of the distal cord.  This mild dilatation does not represent frank syringohydromyelia and does not need to be directly treated.  Often, this mild dilatation will go away after treatment of the tethered cord.",

Contrast enhanced scans demonstrate diffusely homogeneous enhancement. MRI is typically isointense to relatively hypointense on T1 weighted images. T2 weighted images generally demonstrate slightly increased signal intensity in relationship to the contiguous gray matter. Gadolinium enhanced MR images demonstrate intense uniform enhancement.  Although meningiomas are histologically benign, they may invade surrounding structures including the dura and bony structures.

The fibromatoses are separated into superficial - (palmar \u2013 aka Dupuytren disease, plantar, juvenile aponeurotic fibroma, infantile digital fibromatosis) which are usually small, slow growing lesions which arise from fascia/aponeuroses and deep-(infantile myofibromatosis, fibromatosis colli, extraabdominal desmoid tumor, and aggressive infantile fibromatosis) which arise from the deeper musculoaponeuroses and are larger and may grow rapidly.  Both forms have a tendency to recur following excision.\n\tPlantar fibromatosis, like all fibromatoses, are three to four times more common in males.  It occurs between the ages of 30 \u2013 50 and is seen bilaterally in 20-50% of cases.  It is associated with palmar fibromatosis 10-65% of the time.  The fibromas are most commonly seen on the medial aspect of the plantar aponeurosis.  The lesions are often asymptomatic.  Surgery is performed utilizing large margins.

If adequate trials of physical therapy fail, indicated by continued anterior instability and pain, or if multiple dislocations occur, more invasive procedures are performed.  Various surgical procedures have been developed for treatment of recurrent anterior dislocations of the humeral head.  Treatment can be either by arthroscopy or open anterior shoulder repair (axillary approach or the Bankart lesion fixation procedure); other procedures include the Bristow Helfet procedure, Magnuson Stack procedure, Eden Hybinette procedure, Oudard procedure and Trillat procedure.  The Bankart procedure is the gold standard, with success rates of 90-95%.  In associated Hill-Sachs lesions, the glenoid can be augmented with a tricortical iliac crest graft.Traditionally, arthroscopic techniques have had a failure rate of about 20% at 3.5 years, whereas the newer Bankart fixation techniques have brought this down to 10% or less.  Support is gathering for earlier surgical intervention in patients with recurrent dislocations."

            "Disease Discussion": "Anterior dislocations are produced by complex forces acting on the humerus, including abduction and external rotation.  The Hill-Sachs fracture results from this anterior dislocation (97% vs. 3%) with compression of posterolateral aspect of the humeral head by the inferior glenoid labrum. Hill-Sachs deformities occur in 35-40% of anterior dislocations and up to 80 % of recurrent dislocations. Hill-Sachs fractures can occur with subluxations, or single or multiple dislocations.  The dislocation may also cause a Bankart fracture at the impact site on the glenoid.  This is a fracture of the anterior aspect of the inferior rim of the glenoid caused by the anterior movement of the humeral head and is best seen on the anteroposterior projection with the arm in the neutral position.  If radiographs at presentation show no dislocation, the presence of either Hill-Sachs deformities or Bankart\u2019s fractures are indicative of a prior dislocation. MRI is the best imaging modality for identifying cartilaginous and osseous Hill-Sachs deformities and associated tears of the anterior glenoid labrum.  The contour defect of both cartilage and bone at the superior aspect of the humeral head posterolaterally represents the Hill-Sachs deformity and the high signal intensity separating the cartilaginous labrum from the bony labrum represents the tear \u2013 the Bankart lesion.\nThe younger the patient when the first dislocation occurs, the greater is the probability that dislocation will recur.   Thus, patients 20 years old or younger have a 80-90% chance of lifetime recurrence, those 30 or younger have a 60% recurrence rate, and of those 40 and older at time of first dislocation, have a 10-15% probability of recurrence.",

Stage 1 and 2 lesions are considered stable and are followed by close clinical evaluation. Stage 3 and 4 lesions are considered unstable loose fragments and are surgically removed or fixated.

            "Disease Discussion": "Metastatic disease, or more simply \"metastasis\" (single) or \"mestastases\" (pleural) occur when a neoplasm (tumor) spreads from one part of the body to another.  There are three primary modes of spread:\n\nlocal invasion or infiltration\nblood-borne (hematogenous) dissemination\nlymphatic spread\n\nHematogenous dissemination is the most common and usually the most serious type of tumor spread.  Most solid tumors larger than 4-5 milimeters in size grow their own blood vessels. [See Angiogenesis - http://rad.medpix.net/medpix/radpix.html?mode=single&recnum=2733 ]  The tumor has \"angiogenic\" factors that stimulate blood vessels.  Many of these same tumors also have angioinvasive factors that allow the tumor to penetrate through vessel walls.  Therefore, the tumor is richly vascularized - giving it a path to the systemic circulation; and, once the tumor \"embolizes\" the small tumor fragments are able to erode through the vessel and implant into the surrounding tissue.  Thus creating a metastatic deposit.\n\nThere is a \"cascade\" theory for tumor embolization and metastasis.  Blood from the gut is \"filtered\" in the liver, and gastrointestinal metastases usually begin in the liver before they spread to other organs.  The lung filters all of the systemic blood as it passes through, and metastatic disease here is common from all tumor sources.  Brain and bone metastases usually occur after the lung has been affected - at least in theory.  Some solid organs are affected more than others merely because they filter more blood - like the kidney, adrenal gland, and brain.",

Most occur in the dorsal portion of the cord, with 60% intramedullary and 40% intradural/extramedullary.  They are frequently solitary (80%), with the most common location thoracic (50%), with 40% occurring in the cervical region.  These tumors manifest in the fourth decade and 1/3 of patients have von Hippel-Lindau disease.  They often present as intramedullary cysts with one or more vascular nodules and dilated, tortuous veins usually on the dorsal surface of the cord, seen on angiography.  About 40% of all hemangioblastomas and 60% of intramedullary hemangioblastomas are associated with a syrinx.\n\nMR findings typically show an enlarged, sometimes irregular widening of the cord that is predominately hypointense on T1WI and becomes hyperintense on T2WI.  This is due to the cystic component, which is also indistinguishable from the surrounding edema on T2WI.  The tumor nidus may sometimes be seen as isointense (to cord), nodular on T1- weighted sequence within the intramedullary or intradural cystic cavity, but becoming hyperintense on T2WI (usually indistinguishable from the cystic cavity or surrounding edema).  An associated syrinx may be quite extensive, extending over multiple levels above and below the tumor.  Reports have shown that the tumor nidus rapidly and intensely enhances on T1WI following the administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, helping to demarcate the tumor from the surrounding edema, thus providing valuable preoperative localization.  Additionally, focal areas of signal void on both T1- and T2WI may be seen, depicting the flow in dilated feeding/draining vessels.  Initial experience suggests that a densely enhancing solid tumor nodule within a large \"syrinx\" cavity and associated \"feeding\" vessels is highly suggestive, if not diagnostic, of a hemangioblastoma.",

Enchondromas are usually singular, but multiple lesions may occur in enchondromatosis syndromes such as Ollier\u2019s, Maffucci\u2019s and metachondromatosis.  Enchondromas are a benign finding seen incidentally on plain radiographs MRI, and/or CT while investigating other pathology.\n\nTypically, patients are 20-40 years old when the tumor is identified.  The patient with any of the enchondromatosis syndromes is typically younger when the first lesion is identified. There is no gender or racial predilection.\n\nIn the United States, enchondromas account for 12-14% of benign bone neoplasms and 3-10% of osseous neoplasms in general. They are most commonly found in the diaphyses of the hands and feet, and less commonly in the femur, humerus, or tibia.  Enchondromas present as small (<5 cm) lytic masses which have a pattern of lobulated arcs and rings indicative of their chondroid matrix.  When found in the larger bones, they are usually metaphyseal, centrally located and can have a sclerotic margin.\n\nFrequently plain radiographs are adequate to identify and diagnose enchondromas.  Occasionally, further imaging such as CT or MRI may be required to offer a more complete picture of the bone surrounding the tumor.  Bone scans are usually ineffective in the diagnosis of enchondromas as typical findings of mildly increased uptake are non-specific.\n\nEnchondromas are benign but can cause pathologic fractures or can rarely progress to chondrosarcoma. This malignant transformation is of concern due to the destructive changes which occur in high grade tumors as well as the 5 year survival rate which is as low as 15% in high grade tumors.   \n\nTumors found in the hands and feet have a virtually negligible transformation rate while those seen in the long and flat bones should be monitored more closely for transformation. Transformation to malignancy occurs much more frequently in patients with enchondromatosis. \n\nThe following radiographic changes are suggestive of this transformation to chondrosarcoma:\n\u2022 \tScalloping of the inner surface of the bone\n\u2022 \tThickening of the bone cortex\n\u2022 \tReactive bone growth on the outer surface of the bone\n\u2022 \tErosion surrounded by reactive bone\n\u2022 \tNoticeable growth in the bony erosion\n\u2022 \tMRI may identify cortical extension and extension to the soft tissue mass.\n\nWith the exception of enlarged digits when hands and feet are involved, physical exam of the patient with an enchondroma is usually unremarkable. Pain found on exam is attributable to either adjacent but non-related pathology, pathologic fracture resulting from the enchondroma, or should raise the clinical suspicion for progression to chondrosarcoma.\n\nDifferential diagnosis varies depending on whether calcifications are present.  In cases in which they are, bone infarct which may exhibit a serpiginous lining and low grade chondrosarcoma must be considered.  If the lesion is purely lytic, however, non-ossifying fibroma, simple bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, eosinophilic granuloma, and clear cell chondrosarcoma should be considered. \nWhen considering these diagnoses, the following factors are each used to rule out the diagnosis in question:\n\u2022 \tNon-ossifying fibroma \u2013 usually cortically based, enchondromas are medullary based\n\u2022 \tSimple bone cyst \u2013 usually seen before age 20\n\u2022 \tEosinophilic granuloma \u2013 also seen commonly in patients before age 20\n\u2022 \tFibrous dysplasia \u2013 has a ground glass appearance on imaging\n\u2022 \tClear cell chondrosarcoma \u2013 epiphyseally based, with extension into the metaphysis usually seen on MR\n\nWhen asymptomatic, treatment of enchondromas consists of observation.  In the patient in whom a pathologic fracture has occurred, the fracture is usually allowed to heal, followed by curettage and filling of the cavity with bone fragments or cement.",

Therefore, a patient with a Segond fracture, which is usually best seen on A/P radiographs, should be further evaluated by MRI for anterior cruciate ligament and other associated bone, ligamentous, and meniscal injuries. Sagittal T2W MRI with fat saturation is 95% sensitive and 98% specific for showing ACL tears. Treatment for Segond fracture is generally conservative for non-displaced/non-inverted fractures. Treatment for ACL tear is surgical for the athletic individual who wishes to return to his or her level of activity. Best results are usually achieved with a patellar tendon autograft.",

There is an increase in unencapsulated fat tissue within the epidural space of the spinal canal which subsequently leads to effacement of the sub arachnoid space, cord compression, and eventual cord atrophy.  \n\nThe pathogenesis of this disorder ranges from excessive steroid use to frank obesity.  This disease has been observed in people with Cushing\u2019s disease, hypothyroidism, and pituitary prolactinomas.  A number of cases have been completely idiopathic. Most reported cases were associated with moderate to high steroid use.  Thoracic involvement is most common followed by lumbar involvement next.  No cases of cervical involvement have ever been reported.\n\nMR imaging has replaced CT as the study of choice for diagnosis of this disease.  Classically there is bright fat signal on T1 weighted sequences where dark CSF signal is expected.  Intermediate signal consistent with fat is seen on T2 weighted images were high CSF signal is expected.  Fat suppression and gadolinium is helpful but not entirely necessary.  \n\nTreatment options include surgical laminectomy to decompress the cord in cases of extreme compression.

            "Title": "Meningioma",
            "Disease Discussion": "Epidemiology and Location\nMeningiomas comprise approximately 20% of adult intracranial tumors, have a female predominance, and occur most often during middle and older ages.  They may be found in intracranial and intraspinal compartments.  In the head, meningiomas are most commonly located in frontal, parasagittal, and parietal convexities (50% of cases). Less than 10% of tumors are infratentorial; multiple meningiomas occur less than 10% of the time.  Clinical presentation is varied, depending on particular structures compressed by the mass. Headache and visual changes are frequently reported.  A large number of patients with meningiomas are asymptomatic.\n\nOrigins, Growth, and Histology\nThe majority of meningiomas are histologically benign tumors, arising from the cap cells of the arachnoid layer. In many cases, serial imaging studies have revealed a cessation of growth after the time of initial tumor detection. These tumors project inward from the dura, and can cause clinically significant effects due to compression of surrounding neurological structures.  A variety of classification systems based on cytology and histopathology are used with meningiomas.  While the overwhelming majority of meningiomas are histologically benign, the malignant type may result in rapid, widespread infiltration with small (microscopic) \"finger\" projections into adjacent cortex.  In patients with malignant meningiomas, marked deficits in physical and mental status may culminate in death.\n\nRadiological Findings\nPlain films may reveal hyperostosis, erosion, or calcification adjacent to tumor site.  Noncontrast CT's of meningiomas often reveal sharply demarcated, rounded, homogenous masses with slightly increased density when compared to surrounding cortex.  Up to 10% of meningiomas may appear isodense with respect to surrounding brain.  CT may reveal focal cerebral atrophy, edema, or widening of subarachnoid spaces, direct effects of tumor compression of surrounding structures.  Contrast enhanced CT most often reveals homogenous enhancement in approximately 85% of cases.\n\nOn MRI, T1 images are often hypo- or isointense; T2 images often reveal isointense or slightly hyperintense masses. Gadolinium increases signal intensity of meningiomas. A  \"dural tail\" consisting of tissue tapering into the dura may be appreciated.  Imaging studies may reveal extension of mass into cortical structures, or invasion of the calvarium. Angiography often reveals a homogenous, hypervascular pattern.\n\n\nTreatment Options\nA variety of clinical and experimental treatment options exist, including surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.  Resection is the most widely utilized treatment option, although advanced age, concern about loss of neurological function due to surgery, advanced age, and being a poor surgical candidate preclude some from surgical options. Tumor embolization may be employed 3-5 days prior to surgery in an attempt to decrease blood supply to the meningioma. Recurrence of tumor is a possibility after resection. Complete removal of initial tumor and all affected bone results in recurrence rates of less than 10%.\n\nRadiotherapy is often employed during the presurgical period.  Likewise radiotherapy after incomplete resection of a meningioma may be of considerable benefit to patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery with a \"gamma knife\" has shown decrease in tumor size in approximately 50% of cases.  Since this technology is relatively new, long term outcome of gamma knife therapy is not known. Brachytherapy with iodine-125 has been described in the literature; long term outcomes have yet to be determined. Medical treatment options include recommendations of anticonvulsant prophylaxis in patients with supratentorial masses; corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling may also be warranted.  The use of traditional antineoplastic agents in treating meningiomas has not been met with great success.  Hormonal manipulation may have a beneficial effect on stopping tumor growth; research this area continues.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Spinal ependymomas are the most common spinal cord tumor overall.  They arise from ependymal cells lining the central canal or its remnants and from the cells in the filum terminale.  Of these tumors, there are two subsets: intramedullary ependymomas (cellular ependymomas), and ependymomas occurring nearly exclusively in the conus medullaris and filum terminale (myxopapillary ependymomas).  \nMyxopapillary ependymomas represent 10-15% of all ependymomas, and account for 90% of the primary tumors in the filum terminale and cauda equina.  These tumors are fleshy, sausage-shaped, reddish to purple in color and moderately vascular on gross examination.  Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to grow slowly and to large sizes (often spanning 2-4 vertebral segments), often expanding adjacent bone of the lumbosacral canal and neural foramina.  They commonly hemorrhage which can lead to nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and superficial siderosis, as well as complex internal signal characteristics and calcification.  \nComputed tomography of myxopapillary ependymomas typically demonstrates an isodense intradural mass, with possible bony expansion, and strong, uniform contrast enhancement.  Magnetic resonance imaging of these tumors demonstrates an intradural mass that is typically isointense to the spinal cord on T1-weighted images, hyperintense to the spinal cord on T2-weighted sequences, and demonstrated strong homogenous enhancement following contrast administration.  Myxopapillary ependymomas with a hemorrhagic component may demonstrate heterogeneity on T1-weighted sequences, and a low signal-intensity hemosiderin rim on T2-weighted sequences.\nClinically myxopapillary ependymomas most often present with low back, leg or sacral pain.  Leg weakness and sphincter dysfunction are only seen in 20-25% of patients.  Due to their indolent growth, delay in diagnosis is common with these tumors, with an average of 2.4 years of symptoms before a correct diagnosis is established.  Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to occur in males more often than females (2:1), with a peak age of diagnosis within the 3rd to 4th decades of life.   Complete surgical resection is generally curative, although local recurrence is possible if resection is incomplete.  Adjuvant radiation therapy is used for multifocal lesions.  Certain aggressive sacral and presacral tumors may spread locally to lymph nodes and rarely to distant sites (e.g. lungs and bone).",

Administration of dexamethasone is usually initiated at the time of diagnosis and tapered to the lowest tolerated dose when radiation therapy is completed.  Due to the invasive nature of high-grade astrocytomas, complete surgical resection is not possible.  Therefore, surgery is only indicated to obtain tissue for pathologic diagnosis and control mass effects.  In patients younger than 65, the extent of tumor resection correlates with survival, so accessible tumors are resected aggressively in this population if the patient is otherwise healthy.  Following surgery, radiation therapy is administered.  Focal radiation has been shown to be as effective and less toxic in this patient population, and is administered to the tumor mass, plus a 3-4-cm margin.  A total dose of 5000 to 7000 cGy is administered in 25-35 equal fractions, 5 days per week.  Finally, chemotherapy is initiated.  This is only marginally effective, but is usually added as an adjuvant, following surgery and radiation therapy.  The most effective available agents are nitrosoureas, such as carmustine (BCNU) and lomustine (CCNU).",

Grade I and II are considered low-grade astrocytomas and are more common in children.  The majority of astrocytomas occurring in adults are high-grade, grade III and IV.  They are usually supratentorial and have poorly defined margins.  Tumor cells migrate away from the main tumor mass and invade adjacent tissue, often traveling along white matter pathways.  Therefore, imaging studies do not usually reveal the full extent of the tumor.\n\nAlthough all of these tumors are eventually fatal, longer survival has been associated with younger age, better clinical performance status, and greater extent of surgical resection.  Mean survival for high grade glioma patients younger than 65, treated aggressively, is 11 to 13 months.",

Interestingly, Achilles tendon xanthomas occur in less than 50% of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and may be imaged using US or MRI.  Other common locations of tendon xanthomas involve the finger extensors on the dorsal aspect of the hands, as well as the plantar fascia, and less commonly the extensor tendons of the toes.\n\nOn radiographs, xanthomas appear as soft-tissue masses without calcification.  Typical sonographic findings include an AP thickness greater than 7 mm in men, and 6 mm in women, as well as the presence of single or multiple hypoechoic foci, which alter the normal appearance of the tendon.  \n\nMRI also demonstrates thickening of the AP diameter, and a speckled appearance to the tendon on both the axial and sagittal views may be noted, but this is not always visualized.  The infiltration of tendon by histiocytes, is responsible for this pattern.  Additionally, the normal concave or flat anterior surface of the Achilles tendon becomes convex in appearance.  MRI is useful in excluding other causes of focal masses in the Achilles tendon such as tendinopathy, tear, infection, gout, or neoplasm.\n\nTendon xanthomas can decrease in size with appropriate treatment of the serum cholesterol levels.",

            "Discussion": "The mechanism of injury that causes quadriceps rupture is trauma, although this injury can also occur spontaneously. In the setting of trauma, it can either be direct or indirect. Direct trauma results from a direct blow to the quadriceps muscle, causing it to tear.  An indirect injury is caused by a rapid and severe contraction of the quadriceps while the knee is in flexion. Both of these mechanisms can cause complete or partial tears. Spontaneous injury usually occurs in the elderly and is often associated with chronic diseases (although it can happen in healthy individuals) such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or gout. It has also been associated with corticosteroid therapy.  Most tears will occur at the quadriceps enthesis and distal quadriceps tendon near its insertion side into the patella. Medial and lateral retinacular tears occur when there is valgus or varus angulation while the quadriceps is contracted.\n\nOn physical exam a partial tear can be difficult to discern. The findings will include decreased extension strength that is often only evident only when done against resistance. Complete tears are much easier to observe. Examination will illicit inability to extend the knee, soft tissue hematoma, or a palpable/visible gap in the soft tissue superior to the patella. Studies that are done to support the physical findings should include radiographs followed by sonography  when patellar subluxation is not present, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\nOn routine radiograph, findings that are associated with a complete tear are soft tissue swelling, inferior positioning of the patella (also known as patella baja), distortion of the soft tissue planes above the patella, and avulsed patellar fragments. If there is no other injury suspected other than the quadriceps tendon rupture and no subluxation of the patella, sonography, sonography is a useful and inexpensive test  to confirm the  radiological findings. However, sonography does not allow an adequate evaluation of the osseous and cartilaginous structures and  other ligaments such as retinacula and collateral ligaments. When other abnormalities are suspected. MRI should be performed after the plain radiographs. On MR images, a complete tear will appear as disruption of the low-signal-intensity tendon with high-signal-intensity hematoma/ post-traumatic inflammation filling the gap of the torn tendon. MRI also confirms the patella baja. The tear should be evaluated in three planes for its full extent. MRI also demonstrates associated injuries such as medial retinacular tear, with the disruption of the retinaculum usually at its patellar insertion and an infolding of the retinaculum medially and even posterior to the tendon. Hematomas of the soft tissue and patellar avulsions and contusions, and osteochondral trauma can also be shown.\n\nWhen identified, the quadriceps rupture should be treated expeditiously. When the injury is complete as in this case, direct end to end repair is done with immobilization of the knee in extension.

On cine bright blood MR using fast gradient echo imaging, a distinctive systolic flow jet (Figure E, arrow) is noted which arises from the posterior aortic valve into the ascending aorta. This moderate to large jet is consistent with moderate to severe aortic stenosis.  No diastolic jet to suggest aortic insufficiency was seen (not shown).

            "Title": "Bicuspid aortic valve",
            "Disease Discussion": "Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is a common congenital heart defect occurring in 1-2% of the population, with a male predominance [1].  Patients with BAV are at increased risk for a variety of complications that includes aortic valvular disease, endocarditis, ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection [1-4].  There is also an association of BAV with coarctation of the aorta [5,6].  While this BAV-coarctation relationship is widely known to exist in patients with Turner syndrome, this is also seen in non-syndromic individuals.  \n\nThe detection of a bicuspid aortic valve is often incidental, but once found requires routine surveillance for its associated complications.  Echocardiography remains the initial study of choice for most patients.  However, MRI, capable of functional evaluation using cine bright blood techniques and of aortography using MRA, is well suited for further evaluation of patients with BAV for associated valvular and aortic conditions.\n\nFunctional impairment of the aortic valve\u2014namely aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation\u2014is the most common complication (in up to 68-85% of patients [1,3]) seen in patients with BAV.  Aortic stenosis may manifest as a systolic ejection murmur, best heard in the second right intercostal space.  Aortic insufficiency, on the other hand, is characterized by a decrescendo diastolic murmur, best heard at the left sternal border.  On echocardiography, of course, the severity of the valvular stenosis or insufficiency and co-existence of a BAV is typically evident.  \n\nPatients with BAV also have an increased incidence of aortic disease [7-11].  While it is well known that aortic valvular dysfunction is associated with increased risk for aortic aneurysm, patients with BAV appear to have additional risks for aortic disease.  Nistri et al. [12] reported significant aortic root enlargement in healthy patients with normally functioning BAV when compared to healthy subjects with normally functioning tricuspid aortic valves.  Similarly, Hahn et al. [2] report significantly larger aortic root sizes in patients with BAV at all grades of valvular dysfunction when compared to subjects with tricuspid aortic valves matched for age, gender and grade of valvular disease.  These studies suggest that the predisposition for aortic disease in patients with BAV is due to factors other than, or in addition to, traditional hemodynamic considerations.  \n\nDe Sa et al. [8] and others [7,9,11] have reported severe degenerative changes, such as cystic medial necrosis, elastic fragmentation and alterations of smooth muscle orientation, in the media of the ascending aorta of patients with BAV.  Moreover, de Sa et al [8] found more severe degenerative changes not only in the media of the ascending aorta but also in the pulmonary arteries of patients with BAV, compared to that of patients with tricuspid aortic valves.  These studies suggest that the association of BAV with aortic disease results from a common developmental error and not only hemodynamic forces.  \n\nIn patients with aortic dilatation and BAV, the risk for aortic rupture and aortic dissection are considerably higher [13].  The risk for aortic dissection, in particular, has been reported to be increased 5 to 9 fold in patients with BAV [10,14].  For this reason, some surgeons have advocated more aggressive and earlier elective surgical repair in patients with BAV, aortic valvular dysfunction and aortic dilation [13].  \n\nThe clinical presentation of patients with BAV varies and depends on the presence and severity of its associated complications.  Often the finding is incidental, such as being found during a routine echocardiogram for evaluation of suspected aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency.  On occasion, it is identified during the evaluation of a dilated aorta as in this case.  Alegret et al. [15] reported BAV in 20 percent of their patients with aortic root dilatation.  Echocardiography will continue to be the initial study of choice in most instances.  However, with the increased use of MRI in the evaluation of aortic pathology, the evaluation of the aortic valve should be considered during an MRI study especially in instances of aortic dilatation or in cases where there is suspicion or known aortic valvular dysfunction.  \n\nOn MRI, aortic caliber is best evaluated using ECG-gated black blood pulse sequences (Figures A-D).  Note that these images are typically performed during diastole and measurements may not necessarily correlate exactly with echocardiographic measurements.  The aortic valve, on the other hand, is best seen using cine bright blood acquisitions, notably steady state free precession (SSFP; also known as TrueFISP, FIESTA and balanced FFE).  To evaluate valvular function, cine images should be performed perpendicular to the left ventricular outflow track (Figure E).  To evaluate the number of valve leaflets, imaging using cine SSFP (or cine phase contrast, Figure F) images should be performed parallel to the aortic valve plane.  The determination of BAV is made by the configuration of blood flow across the actual aortic valve.  In patients with BAV, the aortic valve orifice is shaped like a lens (Figure F); in patients with a tricuspid aortic valve, like a triangle.  \n\nMRI is well suited for the determination of aortic caliber and valvular pathology, but can also reliably detect aortic dissection [16].  This can be performed using a combination of black and bright blood pulse sequences.  However, contrast-enhanced three-dimensional MRA (Figure G) can particularly improve the diagnostic confidence for the diagnosis or exclusion of an intimal tear and or aortic coarctation [17].",

Management may include activity modification, protected weight-bearing, and/or immobilization of the joint.  Surgical options remain for older patients (with less healing potential) or for persistently symptomatic joints in younger patients; the goal being to stimulate healing and bone growth while maintaining the stability of the bone and joint.  For intact lesions (typically younger patients), drilling, either retrograde or antegrade, is commonly performed with fairly high success rates.  Very painful hinged lesions (flap of chondral tissue) require pegs, screws, or pins for security and provide rapid pain relief.  Full-thickness lesions, where both bone and cartilage have eroded, are repaired using arthroscopic drilling, abrasion with a high-speed burr, or microfracturing using a pick.  All three techniques for full-thickeness tears recruit marrow elements to stimulate bone growth, but in so doing create a weak area that requires very limited activity for up to 12 months after the surgery."

            "Disease Discussion": "Osteochondritis Dissecans is of uncertain etiology.  Possible causations include persistent microtrauma (or one incident of significant magnitude), ischemia, genetic and endocrine factors, and anomalies of ossification.  The leading theory suggests that after repetitive microtrauma to the subchondral bone, focal areas of ischemia and/or alterations in bone growth causes the bone to break down.  The overlying articular cartilage may weaken and either cave in forming an empty cavity or tear apart leading to a detached or nearly detached articular fragment within the joint space.  Two types of OCD, juvenile and adult, are based primarily on growth potential of the bone.  Juvenile OCD (5-15 years old at presentation) typically has a better healing potential and better prognosis; detachment of cartilage is rare in children.  Adult OCD (16-50 years old at presentation) has a much higher risk for developing moderate to severe osteoarthritis later in life on the affected joint.  The knee (usually the medial femoral condyle) is most affected comprising as high as 85% of all lesions.  Other affected joints include the talus, capitellum, and wrist.  Males are affected more than females, 3 to 1.  Typically patients complain of a gradually increasing pain associated with activity.  They may also complain that the knee swells, \u201cgives out,\u201d or locks.  Physical exam may reveal poorly localized tenderness on the affected side along with crepitus and/or an effusion.  In one-third of cases, the knees present bilaterally; therefore, the opposite knee should also be viewed on radiograph.  Radiographic findings are as described above; however, three views (frontal, lateral, and tunnel) are usually required to identify all possible lesions.  MRI is necessary not for diagnostic purposes, but to evaluate the cartilage overlying the lesion.  Identifying the degree of cartilage damage, if any at all, is necessary for proper management of the disease, as discussed above.",

            "Title": "Chiari I Malformation",
            "Disease Discussion": "Chiari I malformations consist of cerebellar tonsillar ectopia.  The cerebellar tonsils typically ascend with age with the normal position in the first 10 years of life allowing upto 6 mm of extension below the foramen magnum and decreasing to 5 mm in the second - third decades and 4 mm between the fourth to eighth.  When ectopic, the cerebellar tonsils may be elongated and take on a pointed appearance inferiorly discribed as \"peg-like\".  When there is extension of the tonsils greater than 12mm below the foramen magnum, symptoms are generally associated.  While other brain anomalies are not usually associated with Chiari I malformations, a variety of spine and skull base abnormalities may be seen, including Klippel-Feil, C2-3 fusions, Basilar invagination and atlantooccipital assimilation. These associated skull base and spine abnormalites are present in approximately one-quarter of patients with Chiari I malformations. Also associated is the development of syringohydromyelia (or syrinx) which is present in approximately 30% of asymptomatic and 60-90% of symptomatic patients.  While the syrinx usually occurs in the cerical spinal cord but can involve the entire length of the spinal cord or rarely occur as an isolated finding in the thoracic cord.  The syrinx represents either a dilation of the central canal of the spinal cord (hydromyelia) or extension of the fluid through the ependyma of the central canal into the adjacent cord parenchyma (syringomyelia).  The two are combined into a single term for MR purposes as they can not be distinguished from each other on imaging studies.  The formation of the syrinx is theorize to occur as a result of altered fluid flow from the central canal at the obex secondary to compression of the brainstem in the foramen magnum region by the ectopic cerebellar tonsils.  Symptoms that may be associated to the syrinx include upper extremity weakness/ sensory deficits which can lead to the formation of Charcot changes in the glenohumeral joints.",

Cavernous angiomas can be seen throughout the parenchyma, more commonly at the frontal and temporal lobes.  80% are supratentorial, often seen within the deep white matter, corticomedullary junction, and basal ganglia.  They can also be seen within the spinal cord.  Within the posterior fossa, the pons and cerebellar hemispheres are preferred locations.  Multiple lesions are seen 50% of the time.\n\nThe most common age of presentation is 20 to 40 years of age, presenting with headache, seizure, or focal neurological deficit.  Associated occult hemorrhage is common.\n\nOn CT, cavernous angiomas appear iso to hyperdense.  Varied enhancement is seen following contrast administration, and calcifications are commonly seen.  \n\nOn MR, a characteristic \u201cpopcorn-like\u201d appearance is seen.  This pattern results from multiple mixed signal intensities secondary to varying stages of hemorrhage.  A low signal rim that \u201cblooms\u201d on T2-weighted and gradient imaging is secondary to hemosiderin and is typical of cavernous angioma.   \n\nReferences:\nBrant WE, Helms CA.

            "Title": "The Deep Lateral Femoral Notch: A Sign of Anterior Cruciate Ligament Disruption",
            "Disease Discussion": "Several apparently minor osseous abnormalities of the knee have been described on conventional radiographs that are associated with more serious but radiographically occult soft tissue injuries. These include avulsion fracture of the anterior tibial spine and avulsion fracture of the lateral tibial plateau (Segond fracture), both associated with ACL disruption and avulsion fracture of the posterior intercondylar insertion of the posterior cruciate ligament (2-4). The deep femoral sulcus sign, however, is the most common radiographic sign associated with ligamentous injury of the knee. Because it is an impaction injury rather than an avulsion injury, it can be a subtle finding on radiographs, and one that is often overlooked.\n\nA normal lateral radiograph of the knee demonstrates a normal shallow groove along the lateral femoral condyle that is formed by the junction of the tibiofemoral and patellofemoral curvatures. This notch is referred to as the lateral condylopatellar sulcus and it is normally smooth and symmetric in appearance measuring less than 1.5 mm in depth (5). During the pivot shift mechanism of injury, the knee while in slight flexion undergoes a twisting injury and valgus stress that leads to disruption of the ACL thus allowing anterior translation of the tibia relative to the femur. As the tibia and femur return to their normal position, the lateral femoral condyle impacts the posterolateral tibial plateau resulting in an osteochondral impaction fracture of the lateral femoral condyle.\n\nThe radiograph will demonstrate an irregular asymmetric appearing notch that is greater than 2 mm in depth. This is referred to as the \u201cdeep lateral femoral sulcus\u201d sign. The depth of the notch is measured by drawing a line tangential to the sulcus along the articular surface of the lateral femoral condyle and then by measuring the distance from the line to the depth of the sulcus (Fig 5). The presence of a deep lateral femoral sulcus is nearly always associated with ACL disruption but lacks sensitivity; the absence of the sign therefore does not exclude the presence of an ACL tear (5).\n\nMR imaging also demonstrates an irregular appearing deep lateral femoral sulcus and in addition it will demonstrate marrow edema within the lateral femoral condyle and the posterior tibial plateau secondary to the impaction injury (6). This pattern of marrow edema has been referred to as the \u201cpivot shift\u201d marrow edema pattern and is also highly specific for ACL injury. See figures 2, 3 and 4 for examples in our case. MR imaging will demonstrate the ACL disruption along with associated injuries of internal derangement to include meniscal tear, chondral injury and collateral ligament tear.\n\nThe \u201cdeep lateral femoral sulcus\u201d sign is a subtle radiographic finding that when present on a plain film can provide an important clue that an ACL injury has occurred. It results from an impaction of the lateral femoral condyle against the posterior tibial plateau at the time of ACL disruption. Identification of this finding on radiographs of the knee should prompt further evaluation of the knee with MR imaging.",

Most fetal diagnoses, however, are made later in pregnancy.\n\nArachnoid cysts usually occur from a congenital abnormality, arising from arachnoid clefts or arachnoid duplications.  They are not associated with chromosomal aneuploidy, but can be associated with brain malformations such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, absent cava, deficient cerebellar lobulation, and Arnold-Chiari type I malformation.  Acquired arachnoid cysts may develop due to CSF entrapment in arachnoid adhesions due to surgery, trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage, neonatal infections, or neoplasm.  They may or may not be connected to the ventricular system.  They can occur in both the cranium and the spinal canal.  They often indent a cerebral hemisphere or invaginate into fissures, however severe compression is rare.  Slow growth may occur with accumulation of fluid.\n\nArachnoid cysts are usually asymptomatic and found incidentally on imaging.  If symptoms do occur, they may include headache, calvarial bulging, seizures, and less commonly focal neurologic signs.  Symptoms may occur due to cerebral cortical irritation, brain compression, or obstruction of CSF flow.  Diagnosis is made through imaging.\n\nDiagnostic imaging characteristics of arachnoid cysts on CT and MRI include having a smooth-surface, being non-enhancing with contrast, approximating CSF, and being homogeneous.  The consistency of the fluid in the cyst should approximate the CSF.  It should be homogeneous throughout, although simple septa within the cyst can occur.  The cysts usually occur near the cerebral fissures, with 50-60% in the middle cranial fossa.  They occur more commonly on the left side.\nSpecifically on MRI, these cysts are isointense or hypointense to brain on T1, and hyperintense to brain on T2.  MRI is superior to CT for detecting complicated cysts.\n\nFetal diagnosis of arachnoid cysts can be made by ultrasound.  Characteristics on ultrasound include seeing an anechoic cystic mass and thin smooth walls\nadjacent to the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, or brain stem.\n\nThis patient's arachnoid cyst is asymptomatic, and is likely not the cause of his hearing loss.  Further treatment of this cyst is not needed unless symptoms arise in the future."

These usually occur in younger women.  They are bilateral in about 15% of the time.  They have a variegated appearance on ultrasound, but predominantly appear as a complex cyst.  They can have a large area of shadowing due to the presence of tooth-like calcifications.  Demonstration of fat in either CT or MR strongly suggests the diagnosis.  Rarely these tumors undergo malignant degeneration into squamous cell carcinoma. (7)\n\nCurrently, the elective treatment of choice is laparoscopic excision.  Series of articles in the literature has shown that laparoscopic excision compared to laparotomy is safe, with decreased hospital stay and less post-operative pain. (1, 2, 4, 5)  Some techniques have advocated aspirating the cyst before the removal (so that the cyst can be removed from the abdominal cavity through a smaller incision), with a slightly increased incident of post-operative fever (presumably from a reaction to the cyst fluid) but without any significant increased incidence of adhesions or peritonitis. (6)  There is the mention of the vaginal route of excision in the literature, with the article mentioning faster patient recovery and reduced spillage compared that to laparoscopic approaches. (3)",

            "Title": "Osteochondritis dissecans",
            "Disease Discussion": "Osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) is believed to result from repetitive microtrauma. The initial trauma is an acute osteochondral fracture. The knee is involved in 75% of all patient presentations. It is most common in young male athletes, with a male:female ratio of 2-3:1. It is rarely seen in patients younger than 10 years of age or older than 50 years. There are two forms of OCD, the juvenile form affects children with open physes between the ages of 5 to 15 years. The adult form is present in patients with closed physes. \n     With OCD of the talus, patients present with complaints of ankle \"catching\" with active motion or walking. They may have swelling or pain depending of the stage of lesion. On physical examination, patients may have diffuse or well-defined tenderness with a joint effusion, pain with tibiotalar joint compression, and/or crepitus with dorsiflexion or plantar flexion.The cartilaginous and subchrondral bone lesions are usually on the posteromedial or the anterolateral talar aspect. \n     OCD of the talus is likely due to trauma causing tibiotalar subluxation with subsequent impingement of the talus on the tibia or fibula. Berndt and Harty observed in cadavers that impaction of the talus on the fibula in inversion with the ankle positioned in dorsiflexion results in anterolateral talar lesions. Posteromedial lesions could be created after inversion with a plantar-flexed ankle with resulting talus impaction and twisting on the posterior aspect of tibia.\n    Radiographs may be adequate for diagnosis but they may also show no findings. Radiographs should always be obtained, but if negative, an MRI  should be done for confirming the suspected clinical diagnosis when necessary. AP, lateral, and mortise radiographs are the standard radiologic images. Berndt and Harty's radiographic classification of OCD of the talus is used for determining the type of  treatment and the prognosis. Stage I is a small area of compression of subchondral bone. Stage II is a partially detached osteochondral fragment. Stage III is a completely detached fragment that remains in underlying bone depression. Stage IV is a completely detached fragment with displacement from the subchondral bone depression.\n     Canale and Belding recommend the following for all Berndt and Harty talar lesions:\nStage I and II - conservative treatment and protected weight-bearing\nStage III anterolateral \u2013 operative debridement and curettage\nStage III posteromedial \u2013immobilize limb in cast or brace and no weight-bearing for six months\nStage IV - operative debridement and curettage",

Other masses in the differential include orbital cysts (which are the most common orbital mass and generally benign), vascular lesions, neurogenic tumors as listed above, and metastatic disease (of which, neuroblastoma is the most common malignancy to metastasize to the orbit). Cysts of the orbit are by far the most common, with dermoid and epidermoid cysts accounting for about 30-46% of all orbital masses; vascular lesions account for about 15%; neurogenic tumors and metastatic tumors both account for about 2-3% each.\n\nThis patient had an MRI series of the orbits done, revealing a retrobulbar mass and the findings listed above. With the mass continuous with the optic nerve and encapsulated by the optic nerve sheath, it makes the diagnosis of an optic nerve tumor much more likely than the other possible diagnoses in the differential. As the mass has meninges smoothly lining it and there is CSF visualized between the mass and the dura, the mass is most likely a part of the optic nerve\u2014leading to the diagnosis of optic nerve glioma.\n\nAn optic nerve glioma is actually a juvenile pilocytic astrocytoma of the optic nerve, which is a benign and usually slow growing tumor. ONG accounts for about 20% of neurogenic tumors in the orbit, there is possibly a mild predilection for females, and it usually presents by 8 years of age. The presenting signs and symptoms are typically slow progressing painless proptosis, visual loss, nystagmus, strabismus, and optic atrophy or edema. About 29% of cases are associated with Neurofibromatosis Type I\u2014typically presenting with bilateral optic nerve gliomas. At the time of diagnosis, about 25-30% of gliomas involve only the intraorbital optic nerve, about 60-70% of gliomas involve the chiasm, of which about 40% have invaded surrounding structures. \n\nManagement of optic nerve gliomas is typically conservative, involving regular interval physical exams and MRI imaging to evaluate for changes in size (physical exam every 6 months and MRI every 1 year). This is because ONGs are benign, slow growing tumors, and in up to 80% of cases, vision does decline some but then remains stable. Surgical and radiologic intervention result in loss of vision and are usually only offered if vision loss or proptosis progresses, or the tumor begins invading the chiasm or hypothalamus. Chemotherapy is also available and is becoming a more popular form of treatment, as it can avoid the possible complete loss of vision and neurotoxic effects of surgery and radiation. Chemotherapy drugs being used include carboplatin and vincristine, and several studies have recommended that chemotherapy with these drugs be first-line treatment for optic nerve gliomas that involve the chiasm and/or hypothalamus."

This lesion can be seen in approximately 30-40% of patients who have first-time anterior dislocations and approximately 80% of patients with repeat dislocations.   A Bankart lesion, which is defined as an avulsion of the anterior inferior glenoid labrum at its attachment to the inferior glenohumeral ligament complex, can accompany the Hill-Sach\u2019s lesion. For patients with a Bankart lesion, 75% will also sustain a Hill Sach\u2019s lesion.    The probability of a recurrence is related to the age of the patient at time of injury.  Recurrence of dislocations develops in 90% of patients under age 20 years, 60% of patients between 20 and 40 years, and 10% in patients over 40 years.   The type of sporting activity (i.e. contact versus individual) and the level of sport participation (i.e. recreational versus professional) is also related to recurrence.   For both lesions males are affected much more often than females, especially active adolescents and adults who are younger than age 25.    However, as young women become more involved with athletics, the incidence of dislocations may change.  Ethnicity of the patient is not a predisposing factor for dislocations.  Although plain radiographs should always be the first study done to evaluate patients with any shoulder pain, MR imaging is the procedure of choice to diagnose and define the extent of the lesion.  In fact, MR imaging resulted in a sensitivity of 97%, a specificity of 91%, and an accuracy of 94% in the detection of Hill-Sach\u2019s lesions.    T2-weighted MR images will show high signal intensity at the site of impaction of the humeral head.  T2-weighted MR images may also show subcortical bone high signal intensity that represents an area of contusion or subchondral cyst formation when chronicity is present."

The patient has tenderness with activity and at rest.\n\nFINDINGS:  Plain films:  Bilateral shoulder and acromioclavicular joints are remarkable for a geographic expansile lytic lesion of the distal right clavicle, with with intact cortex, no matrix formation, and no obvious soft tissue mass.\n\nMRI: There is a destructive, lytic, expansile mass lesion of the distal right clavicle extending into the acromioclavicular joint, with associated soft tissue mass.  The expansile component is seen at its superior aspect, and the inferior distal clavicular cortex is intact.  There are multiple lobulations to this mass, with both high and low intralesional signal intensity components on the T2-weighted images, suggestive of intralesional\nnecrosis and/or hemorrhage.  Patchy enhancement is seen within the lesion and in the soft tissues surrounding it following the intravenous administration of gadolinium.  Edematous changes of the adjacent and surrounding soft tissues are present.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Giant cell tumor, Ewings Sarcoma, lymphoma,  and osteosarcoma. In an older patient metastisis and multiple myeloma should also be considered.\n\nDIAGNOSIS: Giant Cell Tumor. \n\nGiant cell tumor is a frequent benign osseous neoplasm seen in young adults; it has\na predilection for the end of the long bones, more often around the knee. In the foot and ankle region, it is seen more often in the distal tibia, talus, and calcaneus. A multicentric propensity has been seen in these locations. \n\nRadiographically, giant cell tumors are well-circumscribed, expansile, lytic, geographical lesions without rims of sclerosis, and they extend to the subchondral bone. On MRI, they demonstrate expansile contours, often with a rim of low signal intensity, which does not correlate with a rim of sclerosis on plain films. Internally, these tumors often demonstrate heterogeneous signal intensity as a result of the repeated episodes of internal hemorrhage and the formation of cysts and internal septations. Internal hemorrhage may lead to the presence of fluid-fluid levels, simulating an ABC. Sometimes, a giant cell tumor with ABC transformation can be found. MRI can be used to evaluate the articular and soft tissue extension of the tumor",

As the symptoms did not fully recover in 24 hours, a TIA is ruled out. As there are no other findings of pathology, Leukoaraiosis is the most likely diagnosis.The patient's care was transferred to a Medicare-approved Physical Rehabilitation Unit where she is scheduled to continue PT, OT, and Speech Therapy for at least 3 hours a day during the week for the next 6 weeks. While she is trated at this facility, her PCM becomes the physician working there. Care will be transferred back once she completes her rehabillitation and is discharged home. The patient will schedule a follow-up appointment upon discharge.",
            "Discussion": "In this case, physical rehabilitation plays an important role in the care of the patient. Under the 75/25 rule, 75% of patient's discharged from a Medicare-approved physical rehabilitation unit must meet a certain diagnosis, and 'stroke' is one of them. She does not qualify for a skilled nursing facility, although she is not ready to resume her ADLs and IADLs at this time, which makes a rehabilitation unit an attractive choice. What is important to realize is that her PCM will change to the physicians at the rehabilitation unit while she is there, and thus her Tricare-appointed physician will need to keep in touch with that person in order to stay updated about her health. The physician should also realize that vascular dementia is much more likely in patient's with Leukoaraiosis."

These features make this able to be managed non-operatively.  Patients are placed in a TLSO (Thoracolumbosacral orthosis) or hyperextension cast.\nPatients will usually wear these for few months and then undergo an extensive rehab.\nIf unstable fracture or body habitus (precludes casting), surgical management is performed.",
            "Discussion": "The mechanism of Chance fractures is flexion of the thorax on the abdoman, at their junction.  They are often associated with seat-belts and more than half the patients may have associated intra-abdominal injuries - especially in childhood.\n\nCT (especially sagittal reconstruction) is especially useful to define the exent and type of fracture well.\n\nMRI is useful in determining cord injury and impingement.\n\nThere  is a high incidence of associated intra-abdominal injury (liver and/or splenic laceration, bowel perforation) especially with lap belt etiology.  However, in this patient, these complications were not present."

            "Title": "Chance-type fracture",
            "Disease Discussion": "There are 4 types of thoracolumbar fractures often described.  These include compression, burst, Chance (\"seatbelt\"), and fracture-dislocation.  \n\nCompression fractures show anterior column compression (anterior vertebral body) with usually no middle or post column involvement.  Burst fractures produce anterior and middle column compression (vertebral body and anterior neural arch).  Fracture-dislocations involve all three (anterior, middle, and posterior) columns which results in intervertebral subluxation or dislocation.\n\nChance or Chance-type fractures involve the posterior, middle, and occasionally the anterior columns.  The injury results from a severe flexion of the spine with the fulcrum not being the the anterior vertebral body as in compression fractures.  Instead, the anterior abdominal wall (i.e. where the lap seatbelt fits) is the fulcrum area with hyperflexion at thoraco-lumbar junction (e.g. L1). This creates a distraction force on the posterior and middle columns of the vertebra,  creating a horizontal fracture extending posterior to middle.  This fracture may then extend anteriorly throught vertebral body (with an assoc compression of anterior body).\n\nChance fracture is an  \u201ceponym\u201d, named after G.Q. Chance who described this injury in 1948 as anterior wedging, compression, and a frature through the body, lamina, and spinous process.  Because of the mechanisms of injury (flexion over a seat belt) about \u00bd are associated with intra-abdominal trauma.\n\nBurst and fracture dislocations have a high incidence of instability.  Chance fractures also have potential for instability although not as likely as the former two.  Since radiographs may not clearly demonstrate the exact plane and extent of this fracture, CT (with sagital reconstruction is quite useful).  Axial spine CT alone often won't delineate the fracture well due the fracture's horizontal (axial) nature.  MRI can help determine cord compression and injury.",

            "Title": "Enchondroma",
            "Disease Discussion": "A benign neoplasm composed of ectopic cartilage rests that have migrated into bones\u2019 metaphysis from the growth plate. Enchondromas are usually singular, but multiple lesions may occur in enchondromatosis syndromes such as Ollier\u2019s, Maffucci\u2019s and metachondromatosis.  Enchondromas are a benign finding seen incidentally on plain radiographs MRI, and/or CT while investigating other pathology.\n\nTypically, patients are 20-40 years old when the tumor is identified.  The patient with any of the enchondromatosis syndromes is typically younger when the first lesion is identified. There is no gender or racial predilection.\n\nIn the United States, enchondromas account for 12-14% of benign bone neoplasms and 3-10% of osseous neoplasms in general. They are most commonly found in the diaphyses of the hands and feet, and less commonly in the femur, humerus, or tibia.  Enchondromas present as small (<5 cm) lytic masses which have a pattern of lobulated arcs and rings indicative of their chondroid matrix.  When found in the larger bones, they are usually metaphyseal, centrally located and can have a sclerotic margin.\n\nFrequently plain radiographs are adequate to identify and diagnose enchondromas.  Occasionally, further imaging such as CT or MRI may be required to offer a more complete picture of the bone surrounding the tumor.  Bone scans are usually ineffective in the diagnosis of enchondromas as typical findings of mildly increased uptake are non-specific.\n\nEnchondromas are benign but can cause pathologic fractures or can rarely progress to chondrosarcoma. This malignant transformation is of concern due to the destructive changes which occur in high grade tumors as well as the 5 year survival rate which is as low as 15% in high grade tumors.   \n\nTumors found in the hands and feet have a virtually negligible transformation rate while those seen in the long and flat bones should be monitored more closely for transformation. Transformation to malignancy occurs much more frequently in patients with enchondromatosis. \n\nThe following radiographic changes are suggestive of this transformation to chondrosarcoma:\n\u2022 \tScalloping of the inner surface of the bone\n\u2022 \tThickening of the bone cortex\n\u2022 \tReactive bone growth on the outer surface of the bone\n\u2022 \tErosion surrounded by reactive bone\n\u2022 \tNoticeable growth in the bony erosion\n\u2022 \tMRI may identify cortical extension and extension to the soft tissue mass.\n\nWith the exception of enlarged digits when hands and feet are involved, physical exam of the patient with an enchondroma is usually unremarkable. Pain found on exam is attributable to either adjacent but non-related pathology, pathologic fracture resulting from the enchondroma, or should raise the clinical suspicion for progression to chondrosarcoma.\n\nDifferential diagnosis varies depending on whether calcifications are present.  In cases in which they are, bone infarct which may exhibit a serpiginous lining and low grade chondrosarcoma must be considered.  If the lesion is purely lytic, however, non-ossifying fibroma, simple bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, eosinophilic granuloma, and clear cell chondrosarcoma should be considered. \nWhen considering these diagnoses, the following factors are each used to rule out the diagnosis in question:\n\u2022 \tNon-ossifying fibroma \u2013 usually cortically based, enchondromas are medullary based\n\u2022 \tSimple bone cyst \u2013 usually seen before age 20\n\u2022 \tEosinophilic granuloma \u2013 also seen commonly in patients before age 20\n\u2022 \tFibrous dysplasia \u2013 has a ground glass appearance on imaging\n\u2022 \tClear cell chondrosarcoma \u2013 epiphyseally based, with extension into the metaphysis usually seen on MR\n\nWhen asymptomatic, treatment of enchondromas consists of observation.  In the patient in whom a pathologic fracture has occurred, the fracture is usually allowed to heal, followed by curettage and filling of the cavity with bone fragments or cement.",

If detected early there is typically no evidence of disease in the brain or cerebrospinal fluid.\n\nThe true incidence of PIOL is yet to be defined, though it is thought to be more rare than PCNSL which has an incidence of 1/100,000. The patients at greatest risk of developing both PCNSL and PIOL are immunocompromised individuals. Recent studies suggests a possible underlying infectious etiology such as the presence of human herpesvirus 8 and Epstein-Barr virus. \n\nThe median age of onset is the fifth or sixth decade of life with an age range of 15-85.\nTypically the patients present with slowly worsening blurred vision and/or floaters present in their visual field. The disorder usually is present bilaterally (80%) but often has an asymmetric presentation. Initially most patients are diagnosed with chronic uveitis or posterior uveitis and the true diagnosis may delayed for several years.\n\nPIOL has been shown to be predominantly a B cell lymphoma which accumulate behind the retina producing a characteristic subretinal yellow infiltrate \"mound.\" The vitreous cavity contains a cellular infiltrate composed of neoplastic and reactive inflammatory cells.\n\nThe initial workup includes a chest radiograph, complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and blood chemistries. Neuroimaging of the brain and orbits is required along with a lumbar puncture. MRI is not a good modality for revealing PIOL in the orbits. However it is very useful for seeing extensions of the primary tumor into the CNS as seen in this case. Typically the tumor cells can follow the optic nerve into the CNS proper and invade the surrounding structures. Typically, extension into the brain is accompanied by a neurologic deficit.\n\nIn the past the primary treatment of PIOL has been optic radiation. Despite a good clinical response rate of(60-100%) most patients do not opt for radiation due to the associated morbidities. Complications include radiation retinopathy, optic neuropathy, dry eyes, corneal epithelial defects, cataracts, glaucoma and a high incidence of recurrence. \n\nThe mainstay of chemotherapy is intra-vitreous injections of methotrexate. The methotrexate is augmented by a number of other chemotherapuetic agents as listed in the history. Optimal dosing regimens are still being determined in ongoing clinical trials. Many patients do achieve remission only to experience persistent recurrences and eventual CNS involvement.",

Medulloblastoma (PNET - Primitive Neuroectodermal Tumors) and cerebellar astrocytomas account for two thirds of these neoplasms, and the remaining one-third are divided between ependymoma and brainstem glioma (usually astrocytoma).\n\nMedulloblastomas in children orignate most commonly from the vermis.  They exhibit rapid growth, and frequently lead to hydocephalus.  These tumors have a tendency to spread via the subarachnoid spaces.  Up to 50% of patients will have CSF metastases at the time of diagnosis.  These can be found within the ventricular system and in the thecal sac of the spinal canal.  It is imperative that MR evaluation ot the spinal canal with gadolinium be performed prior to surgery.  Metastases appear as brightly enhancing foci studding the meninges.  After surgery, postoperative changes may become enhanced and might be indistinguishable from metastases.  Systemic metastases also occur, with the skeleton being the most common site. Skeletal metastases may be desmoplastic and sclerotic. The 5 year survival rate is 50% - 86% with combination chemo-radiation therapy.\n\nOn CT, medulloblastomas are ususally midline, solid hyperdense masses.  Small (< 10mm) cystic changes can be seen in up to 50 percent, and calcification occurs in up to 20 %.  Hydrocephalus is present in 90 %.  On MRI, they are usually hypointense to gray mattter on T1, and on T2 their appearance is variable.  CSF seeding is seen in 30%.

            "Title": "Intervertebral Disk Herniation",
            "Disease Discussion": "Degenerative disk disease may be accompanied by disk herniation.\nDisk herniations may occur in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar spine. Lower lumbar disk herniation is a particularly common clinical problem. Herniation is a localized displacement of disk material through a defect or tear in the annulus fibrosis. The protruding or extruded material is typically comprised of nucleus pulposus but may also include annular tissue, fragmented bone, or cartilage. Disk herniations can cause localized pain arising from nerve endings in the annular fibers at the location of the herniation. Disk herniations also commonly cause radicular symptoms due to compression of spinal nerve roots exiting the neuroforamen at the level of the herniation or by compression of nerve roots traversing the spinal canal to exit at lower levels. Myelopathic symptoms occur if the herniated disk material compresses the spinal cord sufficiently to interfere with normal cord function.\n\nThe disk space is defined cranio-caudally by the vertebral body endplates and peripherally by the outer edges of the vertebral body ring apophyses (excluding osteophytes). In the axial plane, a \"localized\" disk herniation is limited to 25% or less of the disk circumference. \"Broad based\" refers to disk herniations between 25% to 50% of the disk circcumference. \"Concentric broad based disk bulge\" refers to a concentric bulge of the disk occupying greater than 50% of the disk circumference. Herniations may be described as \"protusions\" or \"extrusions.\" Protusion implies that the widest dimension of the protruded material is less than the width of the separation in the annular fibers at the neck of the protusion. Extrusion implies that the widest dimension of extruded material exceeds the width of the annular fiber tear at the neck of the protusion. A \"sequestered disk\" is a free fragment of extruded disk material which is no longer in continuity with the disk material within the disk space. A free fragment can migrate to any location and lodge above or below the disk space and in rare instances can transgress the dura and lie intradurally. \n\nThe diagnosis of disk herniation can be made by MR or CT. On MR the presence of disk material may be seen extending beyond the confines of the disk space. The disk material may be seen circumferentially bulging or focally protruding or extruding and compressing the thecal sac or nerve roots. This can be demonstrated in the axial or sagittal planes, and, if detected, should be confirmed in the other plane.  In general, the herniated disk material should have similar intensity or density to the parent disk. On MR, this is not always the case, depending on the state of hydration of the parent disk and the fragment and the particular pulse sequence used. [1]\n\nTreatment of disk herniation depends upon the level of the herniation, the severity of the herniation, and the nature of the symptoms it produces. Treatment ranges from very conservative therapies (e.g. bedrest, NSAIDs, analgesics, physical therapy) to minimally invasive therapies (e.g. steroid/analgesic epidural injections) to fully invasive surgical procedures (e.g. laminectomy, discectomy, vertebral body fusions.) Surgical interventions are typically reserved for patients who have failed conservative treatment, who have intractable pain, or who have significant neurological symptoms resulting directly from the herniation.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Liposarcoma is second only to malignant fibrous histiocytoma as the most common malignant tumor of soft tissue. It occurs in both sexes with equal frequency and usually after the age of 40 years. It is found most often in the extremities. Pain is a late symptom related to the increasing mass size. Often the tumor grows slowly, but an occasional anaplastic tumor may grow rapidly. Physical examination reveals a mass with boundaries that may be ill defined. (Canale: Campbell's Operative Orthopaedics, 10th ed., Mosby, Inc 2003.).      On radiographs, the presence of radiolucent fat in liposarcomas suggests a more differentiated form whereas soft tissue density is more consistent with more aggressive forms. (Reznick: Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disorders, 4th ed. W.B. Saunders Co. 2002). On T1-weighted MR images, differentiatied liposarcomas show extensive areas of high signal intensity consistent with their fat content. Areas of low signal intensity and septae in lipomatous tumors suggest more aggressive lesions.  On T2-weighted MR images with fat saturation, less differentiated liposarcomas show areas of high signal intensity whereas the differentiated fat is low signal intensity. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows enhancement of the more malignant regions of the liposarcoma.  At MRI, the myxoid areas of myxoid liposarcoma characteristically show high signal intensity areas on T2-weighted images that do not enhance after contrast. (Shapeero: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging for soft tissue sarcomas. in Seminars in Musculoskeletal Radiology, Vol.3 No.2, 1999)     At gross pathology, liposarcomas are large and lobulated and many are encapsulated.  At histology, liposarcomas are divided into  well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic and dedifferentiated subtypes varying from the low-grade malignant type (well-differentiated)  to myoid subtype of intermediate grade and the pleomorphic, round cell, and dedifferentiated of higher grades. Metastases occurs in approximately 50% of patients and 5-year survival rate of approximately 60%.",

They consist of large sinusoidal vascular spaces which lack normal endothelial tight juctions.  As a result, bleeding is frequent.  The majority of bleeds from these lesions, however, are subclinical with nearly 100% demonstrating hemosiderin staining of the adjacent parenchyma at diagnosis.  There is a 0.5-1% incidence of symptomatic hemmorhage/year.  The most common clinical presentation as a result of hemmorhage is the development of seizures or progressive neurologic deficits, with a seizure disorder being the presenting symptom in approximately 50% of patients with cavernous angiomas.  The degree to which a lesion is symptomatic is,like most CNS abnormalities, dependent on location. Brainstem lesions tend to present earlier with neurologic deficits.\n\nCavernous angiomas may occur anywhere within the CNS with roughly 3/4 occurring supratentorially, 1/4 within the posterior fossa and brainstem, and occasional lesions within the spinal cord.  While the occurrence may be sporadic, there is a strong familial association identified where close to 80% of members of affected families may demonstrate lesions.  In about 50% of patients the lesions will be multiple.  Whenever more than one cavernous malformation is identified in the CNS, there is probably an autosomal dominant inheritence.  This should prompt an evaluation of all first-degree relatives.\n\nImaging findings are related to the degree of prior hemmorhage of the lesions.  On CT, these lesions may be heavily calcified.  MR often demonstrates blood products of various ages centrally and a rim of hemosiderin peripherally.  Gradient-echo images may be helpful in identification of small lesions secondary to the gradient suseptibility or characteristic \"blooming\" artifact produced by hemosiderin.  Following contrast administration, on either CT or MR, variable enhancement may occur.",

            "Title": "Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease",
            "Disease Discussion": "Lesions/Condition: Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease\n\nDiscussion:  \n\nAutosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a disease of tubular ectasia and fibrosis, affecting both the kidneys and liver,  presenting in infancy and childhood.  The frequency has been reported as between one in 6,000 and one in 55,000 births, and the gene responsible for ARPKD has been linked to the short arm of chromosome 6.  \n\nIn the kidney, ARPKD manifests as nonobstructive collecting duct ectasia. Usually affecting both kidneys, the kidneys are enlarged, and the collecting ducts are dilated, elongated, and fibrosis develops in the renal interstitium.  Clinically, this is manifested as hypertension, diminished urinary concentrating ability, and renal insufficiency and/or failure requiring dialysis or renal transplantation.  Severe renal disease predominates in the very young infant, and may be seen in utero accompanied by oligohydramnios from decreased fetal urine production, with resultant pulmonary hypoplasia, and many infants die shortly after birth.  For those patients with mild renal involvement most will develop some degree of renal insufficiency, and some will progress to renal failure.\n\nLiver disease is inevitably found in patients with ARPKD, with variable severity, involving the bile ducts and portal tracts.  The bile ducts are abnormally formed, increased in number, and dilated, and the portal tracts are enlarged and fibrotic. This pattern is known as congenital hepatic fibrosis, and is always present in ARPKD, although is not by itself diagnostic of the disease.  Generally, the liver is not enlarged, the hepatic parenchyma is normal, and there is normal hepatocellular function.  The hepatic involvement is progressive, with patients commonly presenting between the ages of 5 and 13 years with resultant portal hypertension, splenomegaly, varices, and gastroesophageal hemorrhage. Interestingly, when the bile ducts are macroscopically dilated, ARPKD in the liver may be indistinguishable from Caroli disease.  Further complications include ascending cholangitis, secondary to entry of nonsterile gastrointestinal contents into the dilated intrahepatic bile ducts.\n\nDisease manifestations and clinical presentations vary considerably, and ARPKD is viewed as a spectrum of kidney and liver disease, with renal and hepatic disease inversely proportional to each other in individual patients.  Children with severe kidney disease have mild congenital hepatic fibrosis, and patients with minimal renal disease, may have no renal functional impairment, but rather progressive hepatic fibrosis leading to the development of portal hypertension. \n\nPathogenesis of Renal Involvement:\n\nRenal cysts develop from epithelial proliferation along the collecting duct of the nephron.  Symmetric and circumferential epithelial proliferation results in tubular lengthening and fusiform dilatation of the collecting duct.  The result is that the function of the epithelium changes from resorptive to secretory.  \n\nPathologic Features:\n\nThere are numerous dilated and elongated tubular structures, radially oriented relative to the renal hilum.  Obstruction is not the underlying cause of dilatation; the \u2018cysts\u2019 represent dilation and hyperplasia of the interstitial portions of the urteric bud branches that form the collecting ducts.  The kidneys are symmetrically enlarged with a preserved reniform shape, with multiple, tiny cystic spaces throughout.  The elongated, dilated collecting ducts extend from the medulla to the cortex, blurring the corticomedullary junction.\n\nSonography:\n\nAs the spectrum of renal involvement varies, so do the sonographic manifestations of ARPKD.  Neonates and infants with moderate to severe renal disease may demonstrate kidneys that are smoothly enlarged and diffusely echogenic, which is the result of the many interfaces between the radially arrayed dilated ducts and the ultrasound beam.  The degree of enlargement is directly proportional to the number of dilated ducts.  Additionally, numerous, 1-2 mm cystic appearing structures may be identified throughout the cortex and medulla, causing loss of the corticomedullary differentiation.  Occasionally, compressed cortex may be identified at the periphery of the kidney as a hypoechoic thin rim of parenchyma.  Macrocysts may also be evident, becoming larger and more numerous over time.  The bladder is usually small.\n\nThose children who present secondary to portal hypertension have milder renal involvement with normal, or near normal renal function.  The kidneys may appear normal at US, or appear enlarged, echogenic, and have cysts of varying size.  Older children who have progressed to renal fibrosis and demonstrate multiple macrocysts may have sonographic findings that mimic the appearance of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, blurring the diagnosis of ARPKD.\n\nSonographic findings of the hepatobiliary manifestations of ARPKD are also variable.  The liver displays patchy or diffusely increased echogenicity of the portal tracts, representing periportal fibrosis.  The intrahepatic biliary tree may appear normal, or conversely numerous, dilated intrahepatic biliary ducts may be identified.  As patients develop severe portal hypertension, enlarged splenic and portal veins may be demonstrated, and the liver and spleen may become enlarged.  Sonographic evaluation of the portal and splenic veins for direction of flow may assess the progression of portal hypertension.\n\nTreatment:  \n\nTreatment for ARPKD consists of symptomatic management of the sequelae of the disease, such as the control of systemic hypertension with appropriate medication.  Renal failure is treated with dialysis or renal transplantation.  Treatment of the hepatobiliary manifestations of ARPKD consist primarily of controlling variceal bleeding.  Ascending cholangitis is also a possible complication, and prompt management is important.",

It is a conjenital vascular variant that usually does not cause any symptoms of vascular insufficiency.  This finding is most often incidental.\n\nAbsence or hypoplasia of A1 segment should be differentiated from other more serious etiologies that can give similar appearance.  These include dissection and occlusion.  Complete occlusion (thrombotic or embolic) should be differentiated from a conjenital absence of A1.  Dissection or partial occlusion should be differentiated from a hypoplastic A1.  \nCertainly, clinical history and patients syptoms will most likely help in differentiation between variant and dissection/occlusion.  However, the distinction can be made by looking for findings that are associated with conjenital variant of A1 segment.  In most cases, an ipsilateral internal carotid artery (ICA) will be of smaller in diameter and contralateral ICA will be enlarged.  Additionally, anterior cerebral artery (ACA) is usually smaller in diameter than an adjacent middle cerebral artery (MCA).  In case of hypoplasia or absence of A1, a contralateral ACA is enlarged measuring closer to the adjacent MCA.\n\nPeople with either of these conjenital variants have increased chance of developing an ACOM artery aneurysm.",

            "Discussion": "Lateral Medullary Syndrome (Wallenberg Syndrome) is produced by infarction of a section of the lateral medulla supplied by a vertebral or posterior inferior cerebellar artery.  The damaged structures may include the vestibular nuclei (nystagmus, oscillopsia, vertigo, nausea, vomiting); spinothalamic tract (contralateral impairment of pain and thermal sense over half the body); descending sympathetic fibers (ipsilateral Horner syndrome \u2013 miosis, ptosis, decreased sweating); fibers of the ninth and tenth cranial nerves (hoarseness, dysphagia, ipsilateral paralysis of the palate and vocal cord, diminished gag reflex); otolithic nucleus (vertical diplopia and illusion of tilting of vision); spinal trigeminal tract (pain, burning, and impaired sensation over ipsilateral half of face); nucleus and tractus solitarus (loss of taste); olivocerebellar or spinocerebellar fibers, restiform body and inferior cerebullum (ipsilateral ataxia of limbs, falling or toppling to the ipsilateral side).  This syndrome is almost always secondary to infarction, with only a small portion being the result of hemorrhage or tumor.  Most patients recover well, although reports of sudden and unexpected death may occur from respiratory or cardiac arrest in the absence of cerebellar swelling or basilar artery thrombosis.\n\nIt is interesting to note, there was no restricted diffusion indicating this was not an acute event.  Burdette et al. report that infarctions greater than two weeks old, will demonstrate no signal abnormalities on diffusion-weighted imaging. Additionally, contrast enhancement in subacute strokes with iodinated contrast agents is well understood, and is secondary to extravasation of contrast material through a leaky blood-brain barrier.  Likewise, similar findings were documented in this case with enhancement of the lateral medulla following the administration of gadolinium DTPA, consistent with a subacute infarct.\n\nReferences:\nAdams and Victor\u2019s Principles of Neurology.  7th Edition.

            "Title": "Vertebral Basilar artery dissection with Pontine Infarct",
            "Disease Discussion": "Dissections may be spontaneous or traumatic; regardless of the etiology, the underlying pathology is the same: disruption of the intima with extravasation of blood into the vessel wall with subsequent extension of thrombus between the planes of the vessel wall (usually between the intima and media). The most common type is the subintimal dissection, although subadventitial dissections (clot extension in the plane between the media and adventitia) also occur. \n\nTwo theories exist with regard to the etiology of dissections, each of which invokes intimal injury as a final common pathway: \n1). An intimal tear occurs, allowing clot propagation within the vessel wall. \n2). A primary intramural hematoma develops and eventually ruptures through the intimal lining into the vessel lumen. \n\nTraumatic dissections result from three basic mechanisms of injury: \n\n1). Penetrating injuries, which include gunshot wounds, knife wounds, intra-oral trauma (pencils, sticks). With regard to characterizing the location of penetrating injuries, the neck is divided into three anatomic zones: \n*Zone 1: below the level of the cricoid cartilage. \n*Zone 2: between the level of the cricoid and the level of the mandibular angle. \n*Zone 3: superior to the level of the mandibular angle. \n\n2). Nonpenetrating injury due to spine fracture-subluxation injuries. \n\n3). Blunt injury to the carotid arteries. \n\nVertebral artery dissections account for approximately 20% of cases of cervical vascular injuries and most commonly occur between the skull base and the upper cervical spine. Less commonly, the injury occurs between the vessel\u2019s origin from the subclavian artery and the C6 foramen transversarium. Mid-cervical vertebral artery injuries occur in approximately 5% of patient with fractures involving the foramina transversaria. \n\nInternal carotid artery dissections are the most common of all craniocervical dissections, frequently (70% of cases) involve both the cervical and petrous segments of the ICA, and usually spare the carotid bulb. Dissections involving the intracranial internal carotid artery segments, while rare, do occur. \n\nThe radiographic appearance of the contrast-opacified vertebral artery on the lateral view is as follows: the vertebral artery takes a nearly vertical course as it traverses the C6 through C3 foramina transversaria. Immediately after passing through the vertebral canal of C2, the vessel forms an inverted L and turns laterally within C2. It then exits C2 and turns cephalad to pass through the vertebral canal of C1. On exiting the transverse foramen of the atlas, it then courses sharply posteriorly along the posterior ring of C1, completing the appearance of a half square. Finally, it turns anterosuperiorly (a hairpin turn) to pierce the dura as it passes through the foramen magnum.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Stress fractures of the cuneiform bones are rare.   More typical types of stress fractures include metatarsal (\"march\" fractures) and in the lower extremities in athletes, joggers, and dancers.  Common sites include the calcaneus or other tarsal bones (ie navicular, less commonly), fibula, tibia, femur, metatarsal, pelvis, upper extremity and ribs.  \nStress fractures can occur in normal or abnormal bones subjected to chronic loading.  Resnick describes two types of stress fractures.  1.  Fatigue fracture from abnormal stress to normal bone. and 2. Insuffieciency fracture, with normal stress on abnormal bone.  \n\nCauses include RA, osteoporosis, Paget's, osteomalacia, renal osteodystrophy, and radiation.\n\nPlain film plays an essential role in stress fracture diagnosis; however, bone scan and MRI have better diagnostic sensitivity.  MRI has comparable sensitivity and specificity superior to bone scan.\n\nStress fractures appear most typically as a linear zone of low signal on T1WI and a linear area of low SI surrounded by broader high SI on T2WI.  Prompt diagnosis and treatment is key in preventing a tarsal stress fracture from becoming a chronic source of foot pain.",

            "Disease Discussion": "Posterior Cruciate Ligament Tear\n\nPCL has it origin along the lateral aspect of medial femoral condyle and its attachement at the posterior intercondyloid fossa of the tibia. Both the PCL and ACL are intraarticular but extrasynovial\n\nThe PCL is a central stabilizer of the knee.  It is composed of an anterolateral band and posteromedial band that tighten on flexion & extension respectively and restrict posterior tibial displacement on the femur.  PCL is twice as strong as the ACL with a higher tensile strength and a larger cross sectional area.  Therefore, the ACL is more commonly injured than the PCL.  Injuries to PCL account for 5 \u2013 20 % of knee ligament injuries and are usually associated with ACL, meniscus or collateral ligament damage. The most common location for PCL tear is the midportion representing 76% of all PCL injuries.  Avulsion from the femur (36 \u2013 55%) and from the tibia ( 22 \u2013 42%) are the other two locations of PCL tear. The mechanism of injury is excessive rotation, hyperextension, dislocation or direct trauma while the knee is flexed.  The most common causes of PCL injury are dashboard strikes in MVAs and contact sports. Clinically, the posterior drawer sign will be positive in 60% of PCL injuries. \n\nTreatment for PCL tears include surgical repair and non-operative treatment. Isolated PCL tears are usually treated non-operatively.  Surgical repair is usually reserved for symptomatic chronic PCL injury, acute bony avulsion, and combination injuries.",

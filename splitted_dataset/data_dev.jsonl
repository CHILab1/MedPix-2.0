CSF is made primarily by the choroid plexus within the ventricular system, and is normally produced at a rate of 0.2-0.35 mL\/min.  The capacity of the lateral and third ventricles in a healthy adult is approximately 20 mL, with a total CSF volume of approximately 120 mL.  CSF is absorbed through arachnoid granulations back into the systemic venous system.  An imbalance between CSF production and resorption results in an increase in intracranial pressure.\n     The majority of hydrocephalus results from obstructive causes--either intraventricular or extraventricular.  Treatment options for these patients include a variety of surgical options: choroid plexectomy, opening of a stenotic auqaduct, tumor removal (in cases where tumor mass is causing obstruction), fenestration of the floor of the third ventricle, and shunting.  Of these, shunting represents the most common and successful procedure.  Essentially shunts provide a conduit for CSF to drain from the ventricles or subarachnoid space to another compartment of the body.  A variety of options exist, but the preffered route is the ventriculoperitoneal shunt.  Shunts require routine follow up, and in children, revisions on a scheduled basis according to growth rates.  Potential complications include: infection, obstruction, and hardware disconnection, and warrant swift clinical attention with imaging studies to assess the patients intracranial status as well as the shunt hardware.","External Links":"www.emedicine.com\/NEURO\/topic161.htm","Keywords":"VP shunthydrocephalus","Reference":"Brant, WE, Helms, CA, Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology, 2nd ed, Williams & Wilkins, Baltimore, MD, 1999.","Title":"Ventriculoperitoneal Shunt Failure"}}

It is thought to result from\nfailure of compaction of the myocardium during development. Patients have variable age at presentation from birth to the 4th decade of life, with earlier presentations portending a worse prognosis. There has been no predilection for race or sex elucidated to this point.  Both familial and sporadic cases have been documented, demonstrating isolated LVNC and presentations associated with other\ncardiac anomalies.  The patient in this case has a history which points to a familial form; however, no formal testing exists as research into potential mutations is ongoing.\n\nDiagnostic parameters with echocardiography have been used as the gold standard since being described by Chin et al.(1) and later by Jenni et al.(2).  However, more recent advances in MR and CT imaging now allow for comparable if not superior imaging(3) of left\nventricular trabeculations characteristic of the disease, especially in the apical region.\n\nLVNC is underdiagnosed as a result of lack of knowledge about the disease and screening of relatives of those presenting with LVNC (4).  Though echocardiography has historically been the diagnostic test of choice, MR and more recently CT have been shown to be complimentary or superior in detecting the characteristic, 2-layered myocardium (5).  MR offers high quality images, preventing misdiagnosis of the characteristic trabeculations as apical hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or other cardiac pathology.  It allows for acquisition of images in any plane without limitations of acoustic windows and has been utilized to diagnose cases that went undetected by echocardiographic exam.\n\nMR has been found to be diagnostic of LVNC at a ratio of noncompacted to compacted myocardium > 2.3 at the end of diastole, with sensitivities and specificities of 84 and 99% (6).  Furthermore, MR delayed hyperenhancement correlates with degree of wall motion abnormality and has been found to be a positive independent predictor of ejection fraction and disease severity (7).  Others have used the ratio of 2.3 as the basis for CT diagnosis of LVNC (8-10), finding a good correlation to MR results.  CT is advantageous over other modalities in its ability to exclude anomalies of the coronary vasculature which have been described with LVNC (11).  This modality further demonstrates a high spatial and temporal resolution with quick acquisition of images as compared to MR (12).","External Links":null,"Keywords":"NoncompactionTrabeculationsEKG Gated CT","Reference":"1 Chin TK, et al.

While it is true that headaches are sometimes seen with stroke, this patient had no focal neurologic findings at the time of his presentation, which confused the picture.  His headache presentation was most consistent with migraine, if one assumes a primary headache.  If one looks further for causes of secondary headache, the differential includes subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), aneurysm, acute ischemic cerebrovascular disorder, arteritis, artery dissection, hypertension(HTN), pseudotumor cerebri, infection, and substance use or withdrawal.  \n\tIn this case, the team did a CT for bleeding including SAH and mass effect, which was negative, blood work to rule out arteritis and infection, and (later) an MRA to examine the arteries, which was also normal everywhere but the L PICA. Physical exam and lumbar puncture ruled out pseudotumor cerebri in this case. That leaves HTN, ischemia\/infarct, and substance or drug use or withdrawal.\n\tThe patient's systolic blood pressure was elevated on presentation, and with further digging, continued to remain elevated during his hospital course (with diastolic also elevated most of the time). It is possible that his blood pressure had been elevated for quite some time, leading to an occult risk factor.  If his headache was a caused by a hypertensive crisis, one would expect his blood pressure to be further elevated on presentation. \n\tThe patient was taking Effexor (venlafaxine), which is a Selective Serotonin\/ Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitor(SNRI), and has both HTN and headaches as possible side effects.  Stroke is not listed as a known side effect.  However, there is one case study in the literature that describes a patient having a \"migraine-like\" stroke while having a serotonin syndrome.  Serotonin syndrome is caused by too much serotonin in the brain, usually secondary to patients taking SSRIs\/ SNRIs and then taking a second serotonin promoter.  It does sometimes occur when patients are taking elevated doses of medication.  It is unknown how long this patient was taking Effexor before his headaches began or if he experienced any of the other symptoms of serotonin syndrome, including acute mental status changes, involuntary movements, altered muscle tone, and autonomic instability.  Even if the patient did not have serotonin syndrome on presentation, it is worth noting that he received sumatriptan while in the hospital, while also receiving his venlafaxine.   Could this combination have precipitated a serotonin syndrome?  Certainly, however, the patient did not report an increase in symptoms after receiving the drug, so the possibility is very slim.\n\tCocaine is also associated with stroke in the younger population.  It is associated with vasoconstriction, and has been known to cause slow flow in the vertebrobasilar system (which supplies the PICA), among other cerebral infarcts, and HTN.  While this patient does not report any cocaine use, it is a possibility to be entertained.\n\tThe actual cause of this patient\u2019s infarct may never be known, in part because we do not know when the actual infarct occurred.  CT best demonstrates signs of cerebral infarct at least 24 hours after the event.  There are cases of CT being used to identify infarcts earlier, but this is generally by identifying secondary signs (like a clot in the MCA) and in the cerebrum rather than the cerebellum.   The differential for headaches is very broad, but stroke must be kept in mind especially when no other obvious cause presents itself, as it can often be reversed if found early enough.\nReferences:\nClinch,CR.

Fatigue type fractures result from the application of unusual force\/torque onto a normal bone, this is common among athletes (especially long distance runners or ballet dancers) or in military members (especially recruits in basic training or undergoing parachute training).  Insufficiency type fractures results from the application of normal stress on an abnormal bone.  The underlying abnormality of the bone arises from a diverse array of causes, including osteoporosis, Paget's disease, osteomalacia, hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, rheumatoid arthritis, fibrous dysplasia, irradiation, and so forth.    \n\nClinically the patient complains of activity-related pain that is relieved by rest.  There also may be a localized soft tissue swelling or tenderness, though the specific site and activity being engaged in influences these variables.\n\nThe most common site of fatigue-type stress fractues is the metatarsals (march fracture) with the second most frequent location being the calcaneus.  These calcaneal stress fractures are usually found with a vertical or oblique orientation in the posterior or posterosuperior portion of calcaneus.

Based on location and radiographic appearance, this particular patient's findings suggested a neoplastic process, which directed him to biopsy.  Indeed biopsy results initially indicated that a primary bone neoplasm was probable, based on presence of osteoblasts and cartilage.\n\nPrimary bone tumors are relatively rare, with an incidence of approximately 10,000 cases a year in the US.  Using the patient's demographics as well as radiographic features can narrow the differential significantly.  The suspected neoplasms, with the exception of chondrosarcoma, fit this patient\u2019s age group, as all frequently present in the second and third decades (chondrosarcoma has a peak incidence in the 5th and 6th decades of life). Using mass location to assign a probably diagnosis, an osteoblastoma becomes likely as it is often found in the spinal elements. By histology, of the differentials listed, the primary bone neoplasms seem most probable as those tumors are associated with chondro-osseous derivatives.  More distinctively, the radiographic features suggest that there is a cystic component to the tumor, likely aneurysmal bone cysts.  Because only a small fraction of the tumor contains these structures, they are likely to be secondary versus a primary aneurysmal bone cyst.\n\nWhen considering primary bone tumors with secondary aneurysmal bone cyst components, the differential is further pointed.  Only 5 types of primary bone tumors typically display this pattern:  giant cell tumor of bone, osteoblastoma, chondroblastoma, fibrous dysplasia, and telangiectatic osteosarcoma.\n\nFinal pathology reading of the core biopsy revealed the tumor was a chondroblastoma.  This is a very rare tumor, and even rarer is the location of the tumor in this patient.  Chondroblastomas account for less than 1% of all bone tumors; this corresponds to approximately 100 cases a year, considering the scarcity of primary bone tumors in general.  Additionally, nearly 75% of the cases occur in the long bones of the lower extremity - distal femur and proximal tibia\/fibula.  Another 20% of chondroblastomas occur in the humerus, while a small fraction has also been reported in the small bones of the hand and feet.  Case reports have described these tumors occurring in the skull, mandible, maxilla, vertebra, ribs, scapula, patella, and sternum.\n\nThis patient fits the expected demographics of the majority of primary bone tumors: second decade in age, male, black, history of chronic pain.  What is so profound regarding this case remains the specific type of primary bone tumor, given its rarity by statistical incidence, and its unusual location originating from the ninth rib.\n\n\n\n\nREFERENCES:\n\nBullough, Peter.

It is a common complication of congestive heart failure and constrictive pericarditis, wherein elevated central venous pressure is directly transmitted from the right atrium to the hepatic veins because of the their close anatomic relationship.  The liver becomes tensely swollen as the hepatic sinusoids dilate and engorge to accommodate the back flow of blood.  Liver dysfunction arises from a combination of decreased hepatic blood flow, elevated hepatic venous pressure, and diminished arterial oxygen content, resulting in hepatocellular hypoxia.\n\nHepatic changes are manifested as hepatomegaly, ascites, jaundice, and abdominal pain caused by stretching of the liver capsule.  Transient abnormalities of the liver-associated enzymes include elevations of serum bilirubin, transaminases, alkaline phosphatase, and prothrombin time. The transaminase levels are typically elevated 20-fold but normalize rapidly over several days.  Passive hepatic congestion typically occurs in elderly individuals with right-sided congestive heart failure and low cardiac output.  Precipitating factors include cardiac ischemia, dysrhythmias, cardiac or extracardiac infection, valvular heart disease, cardiomyopathies, noncompliance with medical therapy, and dietary indiscretion, to name a few.  Symptoms include weakness, shortness of breath, and right upper quadrant pain. \n\nLaboratory:\n\nIn right-sided heart failure, hyperbilirubinemia may be evident, and the transaminases are moderately elevated.  Occasionally, there is isolated elevation of cholestatic enzymes.  In left sided failure, there is a more marked elevation of  serum bilirubin and of transaminases, which rapidly return to normal when congestive heart failure is treated.\n\n\nSonographic Evaluation:\n\nPatients normally demonstrate inferior vena caval and hepatic venous triphasic flow patterns.  The first two peaks are toward the heart and are reflections of right atrial and ventricular diastole.  The third peak is a short period of reversed blood flow, accompanied by atrial systole.  As central venous pressure rises, the inferior vena cava and hepatic veins dilate because the failing right atrium cannot accommodate the venous return.  Clinically, this is manifested by a hepatojugular reflux on physical examination.\n\nWith elevated central venous pressure, the hepatic veins lose their triphasic pattern.   In long-standing disease, a unidirectional, low-velocity, continuous flow pattern may be seen.  Mixed flow patterns can also be seen on color flow Doppler sonograms. \n\nNormal portal venous flow is steady and continuous except for a mild increase during expiration.  In patients with passive hepatic congestion, the energy of the elevated pressure from the right atrium and hepatic veins is transmitted directly via the dilated hepatic sinusoids into the portal vein.  The result is that portal venous blood flow becomes pulsatile, because the liver no longer prevents changes in central venous pressure from reaching the portal circulation.\n\nAdditionally, sonographic evaluation of the gallbladder may demonstrate diffuse gallbladder wall thickening, which is a nonspecific finding, found in a variety of conditions unrelated to intrinsic gallbladder disease.  Edema of the gallbladder wall, as seen in congestive heart failure, is likely secondary to elevated portal venous pressure, elevated systemic venous pressure, and decreased intravascular osmotic pressure.  However, passive edema of the gallbladder wall may be difficult to differentiate from other causes of gallbladder wall thickening such as an acute inflammatory process in the right upper quadrant, acute pancreatitis, perforated duodenal ulcer, hepatitis, right-sided diverticulitis, and acute right-sided pyelonephritis. \n\nWhen the above findings are considered with other ancillary findings of congestive heart failure to include cardiomegaly, pleural effusions, pericardial effusions, hepatomegaly, and ascites, one should have little difficulty in arriving at the proper diagnosis of passive hepatic congestion secondary to congestive heart failure.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Hepatic Congestion secondary to Congestive Heart FailureHepatic Congestion","Reference":"Hanbidge et al.

Fatigue, weight loss and emesis is a common presentation. \n\nRadiographic imaging is not entirely specific.  Real time evaluation of the small bowel with digital fluoroscopic exams using barium may show thickened and adherent bowel loops with loss of normal barium transit or frank obstruction.  CT imaging often shows diffuse mesenteric adenopathy, and multiple round enhancing homogenous masses.  The tumor often encases the bowel and causes both aneurismal dilatation and eventual stenosis as the tumor enlarges becomes more lobulated and necrotic.

AMLs are felt to represent a subset of familial neoplasms derived from perivascular epithelioid cells.  Most are asymptomatic, and one source (Eble) reports an incidence of 13 per 10,000 adults.\n\nThe typical imaging finding is fat in a renal lesion, thought by many to be virtually diagnostic of AML.  Rarely, however, renal cell cancers and oncocytomas can also contain fat.  Hence, these lesions should also be considered in the differential.\n\nSmall lesions generally receive no treatment, with resection or embolization being reserved for larger or symptomatic lesions.  The primary complication associated with this lesion is spontaneous hemorrhage.  Other possible complications include extension into the inferior vena cava and spread to local lymph nodes without progression to malignancy.  It should be noted, however, that one subtype of AML, the epithelioid angiomyolipoma, does have malignant potential.\n\nAMLs, in particular bilateral AMLs, are associated with tuberous sclerosis.  In tuberous sclerosis, concurrent cysts and, occasionally, renal cell carcinoma may be present.\n\nHormones may stimulate the growth of these lesions as evidenced by the observations that (1) they are generally diagnosed only after puberty in patients with tuberous sclerosis, (2) large AMLs are more common in women than in men, and (3) AMLs sometimes demonstrate significant growth during pregnancy.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Renal neoplasmAngiomyolipomatuberous sclerosis","Reference":"1.

It is important for the mother to convey these findings to future physicians when a chest xray or CT is performed and to relay the current dimensions."},"Topic":{"ACR Code":"65.2811","Category":"Differential Diagnosis","Disease Discussion":"One of the most common tasks in the daily life of a radiologist is assessing new solitary pulmonary nodules. By definition, a solitary pulmonary nodule is an opacity, 3 cm or less in diameter, without associated mediastinal lymphadenopathy or atelectasis. Lesions larger than 3 cm in diameter usually are defined as masses.   Most of these represent bronchogenic carcinomas. But even a smaller nodular opacity may represent a relatively early and potentially curable primary bronchogenic carcinoma. The task of the radiologist is to distinguish such a lesion from common benign causes of a pulmonary nodule, especially a granuloma or hamartoma. Proper evaluation is important so that expeditious surgical removal of a potentially curable bronchogenic carcinoma can be accomplished, while concomitantly avoiding unnecessary invasive procedures for the benign conditions. In some surgical series, <50% of resected nodules are due to a malignant neoplasm. \nThe initial evaluation of the suspicious nodule should begin with a comparison of any obtainable previous chest radiographs. Absence of growth for two years generally is indicative of a benign lesion. \n\nLesion calcium and contour are important clues to the nature of a solitary pulmonary nodule.  Calcium is easy to recognize when it is deposited in a distinctive pattern\u2014such as a central nidus, in concentric rings, or in a popcorn-like configuration\u2014because of the contrast difference with noncalcified areas of the nodule. But it is much more difficult to ascertain when the calcium is distributed diffusely throughout the lesion in a homogeneous fashion. Since density on a radiographic film is an imprecise parameter, the determination of the calcium content of a nodule that appears homogeneous on standard radiography is often quite subjective. \n\nIn most situations when the plain chest radiograph demonstrates a suspicious nodule, CT should be used because it is the most effective, objective, and widely available radiologic technique to further assess the nature (shape, borders, and density) of a presumed solitary pulmonary nodule. Furthermore, simultaneous assessment of the mediastinum and chest wall is achieved, along with comprehensive evaluation of both lungs. Not infrequently, other pulmonary nodules are detected in the patient suspected to have a single lesion on chest radiography. The alternatives generally available besides CT are surgical resection via thoracotomy or thoracoscopic wedge resection, needle biopsy, or the much less desirable approach of obtaining frequent serial radiographs to monitor possible growth of the lesion.\n\nThe basic assumption underlying the use of CT densitometry is that the presence of calcification in a well-circumscribed pulmonary nodule is a strong indicator of a benign lesion because granulomas contain greater amounts of calcium much more frequently than malignant neoplasms. Obviously, CT would not be warranted in an attempt to distinguish a benign granuloma from a metastasis in a patient who has had a primary osseous or soft-tissue sarcoma (e.g., osteosarcoma or chondrosarcoma) or a mucin-producing adenocarcinoma (e.g., colon, ovary, or breast) that might calcify. Also, metastases that have a propensity to bleed (e.g., choriocarcinoma or melanoma) may have higher CT numbers than soft tissue because of fresh hemorrhage or calcification induced by prior bleeding, but such lesions almost always have irregular margins. \nOccasionally, other features are detected that permit confident diagnosis of a benign lesion, such as lucent areas of fat within the nodule consistent with a hamartoma. Adjacent small satellite nodules suggest a benign etiology, most typically granulomatous infection. Lesions that are not truly nodular on CT, but rather linear or ovoid, also are usually benign. \n\nWhile there are no pathognomonic radiologic features of a malignant pulmonary lesion, thin section CT may strongly suggest that a small peripheral nodule represents a primary lung carcinoma. An outer margin that has a spiculated interface with lung or is hazy and less dense than centrally due to lepidic growth favors a malignant neoplasm. An endobronchial component, convergence with a peripheral pulmonary vein, or focal pleural retraction toward the lesion are additional signs suggesting a malignant lesion. A heterogeneous internal composition, especially with small areas of necrosis, supports the diagnosis of a carcinoma. Small air bronchograms, or focal bubble lucencies (air bronchiolograms), in a poorly marginated pulmonary nodule are more common in a malignant lesion, especially bronchioloalveolar cell carcinoma, and sometimes lymphoma; however, these findings may also occur in benign inflammatory masses. If the lesion is probably malignant, a subsequent or preceding standard post-contrast-enhanced CT examination of the thorax and upper abdomen should be obtained for comprehensive staging, including a search for additional lung lesions.\n \nThe margins of the lesion must be relatively smooth in order to confidently diagnose a benign lesion, since a small percentage of primary bronchogenic carcinomas may contain foci of dystrophic calcification. Such calcification, usually eccentric and stippled, is most typically found in larger lesions that almost always have markedly irregular margins. Relatively large and central carcinoid tumors also may contain foci of calcification; a clue to the proper etiology is their central location immediately adjacent to a secondary bronchus. Most calcified granulomas are in the periphery of the lung. Hamartomas, which also may be peripherally located, can contain calcification. It is sometimes characteristically popcorn or chondroid-like, and at times may be detected in conjunction with fat in the lesion.\n\nBecause thinly collimated scans are noisier and subject to greater statistical variation and it is known that malignant neoplasms may contain calcification, it is generally judicious to obtain follow-up chest radiographic study in 3 to 6 months to corroborate that the calcified nodule depicted on CT has a stable growth pattern. \n\nThe presence or absence of enhancement after intravenous contrast administration may contribute further data in predicting the etiology of a well-circumscribed homogeneous nodule that remains indeterminate.  Similarly, FDG PET imaging, which assesses metabolic activity, may have equivalent or superior efficacy in separating a benign from a malignant nodule.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"granuloma","Reference":"Lee and Sagel, Computed Body Tomography with MRI Correlation, 3rd ed., Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 1998, pp393-401.","Title":"Solitary Pulmonary Nodule - Calcified Granuloma"}}

Pneumatosis intestinalis occurs in two distinct forms, primary (15%) and secondary (85%). Primary penumatosis occurs as an idiopathic entity secondary to formation of thin walled cysts within the submucosa of the bowel wall. Secondary pneumatosis is generally related to disease of the bowel wall, or may occur secondary to pulmonary disease.  \n\nDisruption of the normal mucosa by infection, trauma, ischemia\/necrosis, surgery, or secondary to medication allows air to move into the submucosal spaces, where it tracks peripherally around the bowel wall. If enough air is collected within the bowel wall, it eventually spills into the mesenteric venous system, and then will begin to track superiorly and fill the portal venous system.  \n\nRadiographically, pneumatosis appears as multiple thin, curvilinear lucencies surrounding the bowel lumen within the bowel wall. It will be seen within the dependant and non-dependant portions of the bowel, often outlined by adjacent fluid filling the bowel lumen. On CT, gas may be noted to fill the mesenteric vasculature, collecting and eventually spreading to the portal venous system more centrally.  If enough gas is present, air may fill the portal venous vasculature of the liver and will appear as thin linear streaks branching out towards the periphery of the liver from a central location.  Differentiating portal venous from biliary gas may be difficult on plain films, however usually portal venous gas will be seen to within 2cm of the peripheral edge of the liver, while biliary gas generally appears more centrally.  On CT, air may be followed centrally within the liver and its location determined after observing collections within the main portal vein or common bile ducts. \n\nRadiographs will demonstrate pneumatosis and portal venous gas in approximately 2\/3 of patients, however the underlying cause can often not be determine with plain films.  CT will more definitively demonstrate the extent of pneumatosis\/portal venous gas, and will additionally give further clues as to the source of the problem, i.e bowel ischemia, obstruction, inflammation, etc. Once the source is identified, prompt surgical or medical treatment should be started in order to treat the underlying pathological process.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Pneumatosis IntestinalisPortal Venous Gasliver air","Reference":"1.

They occur predominantly in the 3rd through 5th decades of life, but are seen in a wide age range of patients and demonstrate no gender or racial predilection. Most ameloblastomas occur in the ramus and posterior body of the mandible (80% of cases) and patients usually present with a slow-growing, painless mass. Although usually considered benign, ameloblastoma can demonstrate locally aggressive behavior.\n\nAmeloblastoma is typically expansile with an osseous shell that represents the involved bone. They can perforate the lingual cortex of the mandible and extend into the adjacent soft tissues. Ameloblastomas can vary in radiographic appearance. Some appear as well-defined, unilocular, well-corticated, lucent lesions that are often associated with the crowns of impacted or unerupted teeth.  \n\nAs a result, a unilocular ameloblastoma  may be radiographically indistinguishable from odontogenic keratocysts and dentigerous cysts. Other ameloblastomas are multilocular with internal septa and a honeycomb or soap bubble appearance and are often similar in appearance to large odontogenic keratocysts. Definitively diagnosis is by histological evaluation. \n\nTreatment of ameloblastoma depends on the extent of tumor infiltration through the cyst wall and into surrounding bone. Excision of a relatively contained ameloblastoma could involve localized removal of the lesion with wide margins; if the lesion is highly infiltrative and extensive, en bloc resection would be performed.

Classically a patient with a psoas abscess presents with a triad of complaints of flank pain, a prolonged fever, and a limitation in hip movement, however, other symptoms include a pain or mass in the thigh,loin or flank, malaise, weight loss, and a flexion contracture of the hip joint. When the cause of the infection is not identifiable the psoas abscess is considered \u201cprimary\u201d, otherwise, it is \u201csecondary\u201d. In the US 60% of psoas abscess cases are primary, 88% of which are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. For cases involving a secondary psoas abscess the most significant cause is Crohn\u2019s disease; local infectious processes involving the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and bones are also significant causes. In this patient the psoas abscess was located on the same side that a heminephrectomy was performed a year prior to presentation suggesting a possible link. There are a few reported cases of psoas abscess formation following nephrectomy.\n\nBecause of the insidious nature and variation in clinical presentation of this disease the diagnosis is often delayed. Plainfilm, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) have proven useful in the diagnosis. On plainfilm a psoas abscess may appear as a mass or blur the ipsilateral psoas muscle edge. Ultrasound (US) is a rapid screening method for identifying a retroperitoneal abscess which appears as an hypoechoic mass. However, US cannot identify the cause of the abscess and requires an experienced technician. CT has the highest sensitivity for diagnosing psoas abscess and remains the method of choice for describing the structure of the lesion and identifying the underlying cause.\n\nTreatment of the abscess typically begins with a CT guided biopsy followed by drainage and antibiotic therapy. If at all possible the abscess should be drained via the less invasive method of radiological guided percutaneous needle aspiration; however, if this fails, open surgical drainage should be performed.","Exam":"Patient was normotensive, tachycardic, and febrile.

Classically a patient with a psoas abscess presents with a triad of complaints of flank pain, a prolonged fever, and a limitation in hip movement, however, other symptoms include a pain or mass in the thigh,loin or flank, malaise, weight loss, and a flexion contracture of the hip joint. When the cause of the infection is not identifiable the psoas abscess is considered \u201cprimary\u201d, otherwise, it is \u201csecondary\u201d. In the US 60% of psoas abscess cases are primary, 88% of which are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. For cases involving a secondary psoas abscess the most significant cause is Crohn\u2019s disease; local infectious processes involving the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, and bones are also significant causes. In this patient the psoas abscess was located on the same side that a heminephrectomy was performed a year prior to presentation suggesting a possible link. There are a few reported cases of psoas abscess formation following nephrectomy.\n\nBecause of the insidious nature and variation in clinical presentation of this disease the diagnosis is often delayed. Plainfilm, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) have proven useful in the diagnosis. On plainfilm a psoas abscess may appear as a mass or blur the ipsilateral psoas muscle edge. Ultrasound (US) is a rapid screening method for identifying a retroperitoneal abscess which appears as an hypoechoic mass. However, US cannot identify the cause of the abscess and requires an experienced technician. CT has the highest sensitivity for diagnosing psoas abscess and remains the method of choice for describing the structure of the lesion and identifying the underlying cause.\n\nTreatment of the abscess typically begins with a CT guided biopsy followed by drainage and antibiotic therapy. If at all possible the abscess should be drained via the less invasive method of radiological guided percutaneous needle aspiration; however, if this fails, open surgical drainage should be performed.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"PsoasAbscess","Reference":"References: \nAgrawal SN, Dwivedi AJ, Khan M.Primary psoas abscess. 2002.

CLE is a rare congenital malformation. It was diagnosed in 10 of 70 patients with congenital malformations of the lung seen from 1970 to 1995 at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, DC. Depending upon the pattern of referrals, other tertiary medical centers may treat one or two cases per year.  Males appear to be affected more than females, in a ratio of 3:1.  The reason for the male predominance is unknown.  Progressive lobar hyperinflation is likely the final common pathway that results from a variety of disruptions in bronchopulmonary development. These result from abnormal interactions between embryonic endodermal and mesodermal components of the lung. Disturbances may lead to changes in the number of airways or alveoli or alveolar size. However, a definitive causative agent cannot be identified in approximately 50 percent of cases. The most frequently identified cause of CLE is obstruction of the developing airway, which occurs in 25 percent of cases.  Airway obstruction can be intrinsic or extrinsic, with the former more common. This leads to the creation of a \"ball-valve\" mechanism in which a greater volume of air enters the affected lobe during inspiration than leaves during expiration, producing air trapping.\nIntrinsic obstruction often is caused by defects in the bronchial wall, such as deficiency of bronchial cartilage. This results in airway collapse during expiration. Intraluminal obstruction caused by meconium or mucous plugs, granulomas, or mucosal folds can cause partial obstruction of a lower airway. Extrinsic compression may be caused by vascular anomalies, such as a pulmonary artery sling or anomalous pulmonary venous return, or intrathoracic masses, such as foregut cysts and teratomas.  CLE is characterized by overdistention of one or more lobes of the lung.  This leads to compression of the remaining lung tissue and herniation of the affected lobe across the anterior mediastinum into the opposite chest, causing displacement of the mediastinum.  The different pulmonary lobes are variably affected by CLE. The left upper lobe is affected most often (40 to 50 percent of cases).  The distribution in right middle, right upper, and lower lobes is 25 to 35, 20, and 2 to 10 percent, respectively. CLE affecting multiple lobes is rare.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"congenitallobaremphysema","Reference":"www.uptodate.com\nGrainger & Allison's Diagnostic Radiology: A Textbook of Medical Imaging, 4th Ed., Copyright \u00a9 2001 Churchill Livingstone, Inc.","Title":"Congenital Lobar Emphysema"}}

CT has the best sensitivity and specificity if done both with and without intravenous contrast, with narrow window settings, and with 1-cm continuous sections.  The disadvantages include expense, radiation, time, intravenous contrast, and poor visualization of lesions near the diaphragmatic dome.\n\nUltrasound is comparable to CT in sensitivity and specificity.  It is usually less expensive, fast, has no radiation exposure, and allows excellent visualization of lesions near the diaphragms using longitudinal views.  Disadvantages include difficulty with obese patients and those with excessive bowel gas, and a strong technical dependence (e.g., using the proper focal length or frequency of transducer).  Both CT and ultrasound have the advantage of visualizing multiple organs in the search for a primary lesion.\n\nScintigraphy has the lowest specificity and sensitivity but is fast, relatively inexpensive, and has few technical dependencies.  Disadvantages are a low specificity, visualization limited to the liver and spleen, poor visualization of small or deep lesions, and limited usefulness in the face of underlying hepatocellular disease.\n\nEach modality has specific advantages that can be applied to particular situations.  For example, ultrasound is ideal for lesions in the left lobe or near the dome of the liver and at times can define small lesions not seen with other methods. Other lesions may be better seen with CT; however, this is usually not predictable in advance.  In general, scintigraphy is the least informative of the three techniques.\n\nLiver function tests are used as the initial screening for hepatic metastases.  They are nonspecific and also surprisingly insensitive for occult hepatic metastases.  With occult hepatic metastases, the tests for serum enzymes have the following sensitivities: alkaline phosphatase 6%, SGOT 38%, and LDH 81% (the most sensitive).  Once the hepatic metastases are palpable, all of these tests have sensitivities greater than 80%.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":null,"Title":"Liver metastases, from bronchogenic carcinoma"}}

The perforation is thought to result from a dramatic increase in intra-esophageal pressure caused by such activities as coughing, retching, heavy lifting or even parturition.  The perforation usually occurs in the left posterior aspect of the lower esophagus near the gastro-esophageal junction. Patient presentation includes severe chest pain after straining in up to 95% of cases and hematemesis in up to 30%.  It occurs 5 times more commonly in males.  Chest X-ray classically shows pneumomediastinum and pleural effusion.  The effusion tends to be greater on the left. Chest radiographs are said to be abnormal in up to 90% of cases of esophageal perforation although abnormalities \nmay be non-specific and may not be evident immediately after the perforation occurs. Other radiographic findings that may result from esophageal perforation include subcutaneous emphysema, mediastinal air-fluid levels, mediastinal widening, pneumothorax, hydrothorax, or pulmonary infiltrates. CT allows more sensitive evaluation for mediastinal fluid and air in addition to pleural effusion.  Radiographic \ncontrast study of the esophagus may show the site of perforation although the false negative rate has been reported as high as 10%.  The study can be done with water-soluble contrast and\/or thin barium depending on the preference of the cardiovascular surgeon. The risk of using water-soluble contrast is pulmonary edema if patient aspirates, \nand the risk of using barium is reportedly barium mediastinitis if barium leaks into the  medistinum through a large perforation. \nOf the various causes of esophageal perforation, postemetic spontanous perforation is considered the most morbid secondary to massive contamination and frequently delayed diagnosis. This is in contrast to iatrogenic injuries which are frequently diagnosed at the time of injury. The reported mortality with early primary repair varies widely ranging from 43% (even if the condition is diagnosed and treated less than 24 hours after perforation) to as low as 5% in some reports.  The most important factor in regards to morbidity is the length of time between perforation and repair. On occasion with very small contained perforations the cardiovascular surgeon may elect conservative management, but in the majority of cases immediate surgical repair is necessary.  Conservative management is associated with a 22 to 38% mortality. The difficulty with nonoperative management is prospective determination of which perforation will remain contained and which will cause continued contamination with subsequent uncontrolled infection. Sepsis, shock, pneumothorax, pneumoperitoneum, mediastinal emphysema, and respiratory failure are all absolute indications for rapid surgical interventions.","External Links":"www.amershamhealth.com\/medcyclopaedia\/Volume%20IV%201\/ BOERHAAVES%20SYNDROME.asp","Keywords":"Esophageal perforationBoerhaave's SyndromeHematemesis","Reference":"Grainger & Allison's Diagnostic Radiology: A Textbook of Medical Imaging, 4th Ed., pp 1032-1033\nFeldman: Sleisenger & Fordtran's Gastrointestinal and Liver Disease, 7th ed. pp 637-640 \nTownsend: Sabiston Textbook of Surgery, 16th ed. p 724","Title":"Boerhaave's syndrome"}}

It is associated with familial disorders such as multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type II and in von Hippel-Lindau, therefore a family history and test for other associated abnormalities should be performed.  The diagnosis is typically confirmed by measuring elevated plasma and urinary catecholamines and their metabolites and from radiographic tests.   Treatment is primarily surgical with extirpation after the patient has been appropriately medically prepared, typically with a regimen of 10-14 days of alpha blockade.  Beta blockade may be added after adequate alpha blockade.  Hypertensive crises are typically treated with nitroprusside or phentolamine.

The tumor is highly lethal and is usually unresectable at presentation. The average survival time of a patient with this disease is only 8 months or less. These tumors usually occur in the seventh decade of life.  \n\nCurrently, computed tomography (CT) is the most commonly used imaging method in the assessment of pancreatic tumors. The sensitivity of CT detection of pancreatic tumors is reported to be more than 90% when direct or indirect signs are used for diagnosis[1]. However, the potential to differentiate exocrine (non-endocrine) tumors of the pancreas is limited. \n\nOn non-enhanced CT imaging, there is often a slightly decreased attenuating pancreatic mass seen. Following rapid bolus of contrast injection, the tumor usually appears as a hypodense mass with ill-defined borders. Calcification is almost never present within the mass. Indirect signs of a pancreatic mass include abrupt obstruction of the common bile and\/or pancreatic duct and atrophy of pancreatic tissue beyond the tumor. The typical distribution of ductal cell adenocarcinoma is as follows: 60\u201370% at the pancreatic head, 10% the body, 5% the tail, 5% both head and body, and about 10% body and tail [1]. \n\nThose who present with a pancreatic head mass often have symptoms earlier than in those with pancreatic tail masses, mainly due to symptomatic obstruction of the biliary or pancreatic duct. Radiographic assessment of resectability is critical because surgical resection offers the only hope of cure[2].  However, the surgery itself carries a high morbidity. Resectable patients may live 1-2 years. Signs of potential resectability include an isolated pancreatic mass with or without dilation of the bile or pancreatic ducts or combined dilation of both the bile and pancreatic ducts without an identifiable pancreatic head mass.","Exam":"N\/A","Findings":"Film #1: Non-enhanced CT image shows a slightly decreased attenuating focal mass in the pancreatic body with diffuse atrophic changes.

Weight loss and\/or back pain are also presentations for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Pancreatic adenocarcinomas are lethal tumors, usually unresectable at presentation with average survival time estimated to be 5-8 months. \n\nRadiographic assessment of resectability is critical because surgical resection offers the only hope of cure. Thin-slice contrast-enhanced CT is generally more sensitive than ultrasound for radiographic characterization. Tumors appear hypodense on CT.

Numerous clinical conditions predispose to PE, including recent surgery (within 3 months), immobilization, thrombophlebitis, and underlying malignancy or other causes of a hypercoagulable state.   In women, pregnancy and use of estrogen are known risk factors.\n\nThe clinical presentation is often variable, and nonspecific, and dependent upon the size and number of emboli occluding the pulmonary circulation.  The classic presenting triad of dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, and hemoptysis is infrequently encountered.  The majority of patients presenting with PE demonstrate tachypnea, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough.  Patients may have a feeling of impending doom.  Tachycardia is commonly present.  Less commonly, patients may demonstrate wheezing, hypotension and syncope.\n\nThe D-dimer blood test is a screening tool for PE.  If a serum level less than 500 ng\/L, further evaluation with imaging is unnecessary since the post-test probability of PE is 5% or lower.\n\nThe radiographic findings are often nonspecific and depend on whether the pulmonary emboli are associated with infarction. Abnormalities seen include an increase in the size of the central pulmonary arteries because of the presence of a large embolus.  Local oligemia may be present in the area distal to the PE.  Westermark\u2019s sign is when oligemia involves an entire lung secondary to a proximal clot.  A small pleural effusion may be evident. In severe cases acute cor pulmonale may be seen with cardiac enlargement and prominence of the superior vena cava and azygos vein.  Other findings include an elevated hemidiaphragm on the affected side, small pleural effusions, atelectasis with linear opacities, and occasionally Hamptom\u2019s hump, which is a pleura-based , wedge-shaped density may be evident.\n\nThe source of PE is most commonly from deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity.  Treatment most commonly consists of anticoagulation, which prevents clot propagation and allows endogenous fibrinolytic activity to dissolve existing thrombi.  Anticoagulation decreases mortality from 30-60% to less than 5%.  \n\nPrior to the advent of CT angiography, V\/Q studies had been the mainstay for screening symptomatic patients for the presence of pulmonary embolism.  A normal perfusion scan excludes PE with a negative predictive value close to 100%.  A low-probability V\/Q scan combined with a low-probability clinical assessment results showed PE in only 4% of patients.  A high-probability V\/Q scan in a patient with high-probability clinical findings showed PE in 96% of patients.  With other combinations, PE was present in 16%-88% of patients requiring further evaluation.  \n\nThe V\/Q scan is safe, widely available, and is an alternative chest imaging technique for patients who cannot undergo CT angiography.  One problem with scintigraphy is that many patients do not have a definitive result, (high or low probability)  and limited alternative diagnostic information is provided.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"High-Probability V\/QPulmonary EmbolusV\/Q scan","Reference":"Thrall: Nuclear Medicine.

See below.\n\nAn increase risk of Wilms tumor has been associated with several syndromes.  Although syndrome association accounts for less than 10 percent of tumors, syndrome possibility should be considered when evaluating for Wilms.  Syndromes include:\n\n1.  WAGR syndrome (wilms, aniridia, genital anomalies, mental retardation).\n- 33% chance in developing Wilms tumor.\n- Studies on WAGR patients led to identification of first Wilms tumor associated gene (WT1). Tumors manifestation is thought to follow the \u201c Two hit\u201d theory with the syndrome producing the first hit.\n2.  Denys-Drash syndrome (gonadal dysgenesis, gonadoblastoma, early onset renal failure).\n- 90% develop Wilms tumor.\n- Bi-allelic inactivation of WT1.\n3.  Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (organomegaly, macroglossia, hemihypertorphy, adrenal cytomegaly)\n- 5% chance of developing Wilms tumor\n- Thought to involve second locus (WT2).\n\nThe primary differential in evaluating a possible Wilms tumor is to distinguish it from a neuroblastoma (the most common extracranial solid tumor of childhood). Specifically, by determining if the mass arises from the kidney and therefore most likely a Wilms tumor or whether it arises from the suprarenal region and more likely a neuroblastoma. The table below outlines differentiating features between the two.

The Nation Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTSG) advocates for a surgery up-front approach allowing for a more accurate histologic and tumor extent assessment. The International Society of Pediatric Oncology (SIOP) advocates for chemotherapy first which reduces tumor volume and likely the possibility of tumor spillage during removal.  Both stratagies use their own somewhat complicated staging system but generally follow the more simplistic outline below.  \n\nI.\tConfined to kidney\nII.\tExtension into perinephric spaces\nIII.\tLymphnode involvement\nIV.\tMets to liver\/lung\nV.\tBilateral kidney involvement\n\nIt is important to note that due to the differences in surgical timing and variations in criteria a \u201cstage to stage\u201d comparison of the two staging systems is confounded. It is also important to note the histologic characteristics are felt to be a more powerful prognostic indicator for Wilms.\n\nThe prognosis for Wilms tumor is generally good with excellent results obtained with a combination of nephrectomy and chemotherapy in most cases. Survival rates are reported as high as 90% which includes tumors that have spread beyond the kidney.  Tumors with diffuse anaplasia have a less favorable outcome and reinforce the importance of correctly identifying the histologic pattern.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"WilmsNephroblastoma","Reference":"1.

Despite its histologic complexity, LSMFT has a relatively characteristic radiologic appearance and skeletal distribution [1]. \n\nLSMFT is usually an incidental finding. According to Gilkey [2], they have a broad adult age range, but quite likely have their inception in childhood and slowly alter their appearance over a lifetime. In the majority of instances asymptomatic discovery, lack of distortion of bone outline, and sclerotic borders are indications of stability over many years. Other lesions gradually enlarge, predisposing to pathologic fracture. \n\nThe designation of \"sclerosing\" refers to the intralesional bone formed or mineralized within altered fat. The term \"myxofibrous\" refers to the fibrous or myxofibrous areas. \n\nThe radiologic appearance of LSMFT is often quite characteristic. LSMFT has a striking predilection for the femur: In a study by Kransdorf, et al, approximately 85% of the lesions were at this site, and 91% of the femoral lesions were in the intertrochanteric region. Radiographs typically showed a geographic lesion with a well-defined, often extensively sclerotic margin. The bone contour was normal or showed mild expansile remodeling. Mineralization within the lesion was not uncommon. \n\nLSMFT can be readily distinguished from intraosseous lipoma on CT scans or MR images by the identification of fat within a lipoma. Intraosseous lipomas do occur in the proximal femur, and the differentiation between LSMFT and intraosseous lipoma with involutional change may not be possible on imaging studies. Similarly, in some cases, differentiation between infarct and myxoma may not be possible. \n\nMalignant transformation in lipomatous lesions has been well documented. The prevalence of malignant transformation in LSMFT has been previously reported to be 10%\u201316%. The increased propensity of LSMFT for malignant transformation is likely to be secondary to its extensive involutional and ischemic change, with the associated sarcoma arising from areas of ischemic ossification within the lesion or from progressive in situ atypism of the altered lipomatous elements. \n\nIn summary, LSMFT of bone is a lesion characterized by a complex admixture of histologic patterns.

Sixty five percent of patients that have symptoms of acute appendicitis for longer than 48 hours present with perforation of the appendix due to significant inflammation and necrosis. Perforation of the appendix can cause widespread intraperitoneal contamination or a sealed-off abscess, and can be lethal if not promptly recognized. The size of the perforation, the virulence of bacterial infection, and the ability of the infection to be contained will determine the extent of the inflammatory response. Abscesses are variable in size, have low attenuation numbers (10 to 30 Hounsfield units) and may display an identifiable capsule which signals chronicity. If the abscess is due to gas-forming bacteria or fistulization to bowel occurs, bubbles of air or air-fluid levels may be observed.  Abscesses may be found in locations distant from the cecum due to variable position of the appendix and the patterns of fluid migration in the peritoneal cavity. Most abscesses are located inferior, medial, or posterior to the cecum or in the right paracolic gutter.  \n\nIt has been suggested that imaging is not necessary if a patient presents with history and physical exam strongly suggestive of acute appendicitis. However, imaging is advisable for the patients with atypical symptoms, infants, small children, and young women\n\nRadiographs demonstrate some abnormality in up to 80% of patients with acute appendicitis. Appendicoliths are the most specific radiographic sign, but are only found in 10% of patients with acute appendicitis. However, when an appendicolith is present, the incidence of perforation is nearly 50%. Appendicoliths can be differentiated from bone islands, ureteral stones and pheleboliths by their calcified rims.  In cases of retrocecal appendicitis, the appendicolith may be located in the right upper quadrant. Other radiographic findings suggestive of acute appendicitis are: cecal ileus, right lower quadrant fluid levels, paucity of right lower quadrant gas, distortion of flank stripe, loss of psoas margin, loss of properitoneal flank stripe, thickening of cecal wall, scoliosis, mottled gas collection in right lower quadrant, and pneumoperitoneum\n\nHigh resolution or helical CT techniques have been shown to be superior to radiographs in establishing the diagnosis of acute appendicitis due to high accuracy and sensitivity. CT scans have accuracy of 96% to 98%, sensitivity of 96% to 100%, specificity 95% to 97%, a PPV of 97% to 99%, and a NPV of 88% to 100%\nThe diagnosis of appendicitis can be made with confidence when an abnormal appendix is identified or when an appendicolith associated with a phlegmon or abscess is detected in the right lower quadrant.  The abnormal appendix appears slightly distended, fluid filled structure about 0.5 to 2cm in diameter.  In almost all cases of acute appendicitis, the appendiceal wall may display circumferential and asymmetrical thickening. Periappendicieal inflammation is another hallmark of acute appendicitis. The inflammatory response is variable and may show the following: Slightly increased hazy density of the mesenteric fat, linear strands, fluid containing abscesses, or heterogeneous ill defined soft tissue densities representing a phelgmon. A summary of findings of acute appendicitis seen on CT scan are listed below:\n\nCircumferential mural thickening of appendix \nMural contrast enhancement\nAppendicolith\nHazy, streaked periappendiceal densities\nPericecal soft tissue mass (phlegmon)\nPericecal fluid collection (abscess)\nMural thickening of adjacent cecum and terminal ileum \u201cArrowhead sign\u201d\nCecal bar\nFocal cecal apical thickening\nEnlarged lymph nodes\nPneumoperitoneum\n\nIn patients without acute appendicitis CT is also useful as it is able to diagnose other intra abdominal conditions.

These diverticula protrude through a muscular gap in the anterolateral wall of the cervical esophagus below the cricopharyngeus muscle and lateral to the longitudinal muscle of the esophagus just below its insertion on the cricoid cartilage. This gap should be differentiated from the muscular gap in the posterior portion of the cricopharyngeus, the site of development of a Zenker's diverticulum. \n\nBoth Zenker's diverticulum and Killian-Jamieson diverticula occur at locations of anatomic weakness in the hypopharynx or cervical esophagus near the cricopharyngeus muscle. In contrast to the Killian-Jamieson diverticulum, a Zenker's diverticulum originates on the posterior wall of the pharyngoesophageal segment in a midline area of weakness just above the cricopharyngeus.  On pharyngoesophagography, it is seen lying posterior to the cervical esophagus on lateral images and in the midline on frontal images. In contrast, the Killian-Jamieson diverticulum is seen lying lateral to the cervical esophagus on frontal images and overlapping the anterior wall of the cervical esophagus on lateral images. \n\nThe diagnosis of either type of diverticulum is based primarily on the radiographic findings rather than on endoscopy. While endoscopy may identify the opening of a either type of diverticulum, its location in relation to the cricopharyngeus muscle is best seen when passage of the barium bolus outlines the protruding cricopharyngeus. The size of the sac and the relationship of the sac to the cervical esophagus are also best evaluated on barium studies. Therefore, the two forms of diverticula can be differentiated on the based upon the radiographic findings. \n\nStudies indicate that Killian-Jamieson diverticula are less common and considerably smaller than Zenker's diverticulum.

Acute and\/or chronic subdural hematomas and cerebral contusion are common in child abuse.  Intracerebral hematomas and epidural hematomas are uncommon.\n\nUntreated acute subdural hematomas undergo a series of predictable pathologic changes.  Soon after the acute hemorrhage, the blood collection becomes surrounded by endothelial cells and there is invasion by granulation tissue.  Progressive liquefaction of the hematoma results in its conversion to a serous fluid.  These serous subdural collections are referred to as chronic subdural hematomas or subdural hygromas.  Chronic subdural hematomas, related to prior trauma, are most often located adjacent to one or both cerebral convexities but may also extend into the interhemispheric fissure.\n\nThe CT appearance of a subdural hematoma varies according to the time period since the injury.  The initial hemorrhage is visualized as a high-attenuation fluid collection on CT.  The attenuation values of the lesion progressively decrease over the next weeks to months.  Chronic subdural hematomas usually contain serous fluid and produce attenuation values slightly greater than those of CSF.  It is not uncommon for an abused child to have suffered multiple episodes of trauma, resulting in intracranial hematomas in different stages of evolution.\n\nAt times, chronic subdural hematomas are difficult to differentiate from enlargement of the subarachnoid spaces.  In many cases, a distinct transition is visible between the subdural fluid collection and the slightly lower attenuation CSF of the subarachnoid space.  A membrane of variable thickness separating the two spaces may be identifiable.  The brain adjacent to a chronic subdural hematoma is often displaced, and the sulci may be compressed and effaced.  In contradistinction, enlarged subarachnoid spaces are associated with interdigitation of the fluid into the cerebral sulci.\n\nThe differential diagnosis of isolated chronic subdural fluid collections in infants includes bacterial meningitis, remote trauma, rickets, and Menke's syndrome.  In the absence of a clear-cut, suitable clinical history of other forms of trauma, the CT demonstration of coexistent acute and chronic subdural hematomas is highly suggestive of child abuse.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":null,"Title":"Battered child syndrome.

The mechanism of the hyperflexion injury is usually a significant force directed against the occiput, forcing the face towards the chest, and resulting primarily in distraction of the posterior structures, with a lesser force vector resulting in compression of the anterior column.  The spectrum of injuries ranges from the relatively stable \u201chyperflexion sprain\u201d to the unstable flexion injuries (flexion teardrop fractures and bilateral locked\/jumped facets).  \n\nThe \u201chyperflexion sprain\u201d is a ligamentous injury associated with varying degrees of disruption of the posterior ligaments (progressively involving the supraspinous ligaments, interspinous ligaments, facet joint capsules, and posterior longitudinal ligament, respectively), usually without associated fractures.  These patients present with persistent pain, muscle spasms and, occasionally, mild reversible neurologic defects.  Radiographic abnormalities, when they are present, include widening of the interspinous distance or posterior aspect of the apophyseal joints, and\/or localized kyphotic angulation of the cervical spine. \n\nOccasionally, a pure hyperflexion injury of the cervical spine completely spares the posterior ligaments and results only in osseous disruption of the anterior column, manifesting as either avulsion of the anterior portion of the superior vertebral ring (in the immature skeleton) or simple compression fractures of one or more vertebrae (in adults).\n\nAnother stable hyperflexion injury of the C-spine is the clay-shoveler\u2019s fracture, an oblique fracture of one or more of the spinous processes of the sixth cervical through third thoracic vertebrae, from avulsion by the supraspinous ligament.\n\n============== UNSTABLE INJURY ================\nAs previously mentioned, bilateral locked\/jumped facets are one example of an unstable hyperflexion injury and result from rupture of the posterior portion of the annulus fibrosus, the posterior longitudinal ligament, and the capsular, interspinous, and supraspinous ligaments.  Destabilization of the ligamentous support-structure of the spine allows such severe anterolisthesis of the cephalad portion of the cervical spinal column that facet locking occurs, with resultant severe narrowing of both the spinal canal and intervertebral neural foramina.  Consequently, this injury pattern is invariably associated with neurologic deficits (75 percent of cases).  The radiographic hallmark of bilateral jumped\/locked facets is greater than 50% (half the width of the vertebral body) of anterior displacement of the superior vertebra, as demonstrated on the lateral radiograph.  Associated osseous injuries include avulsion fractures of the spinous process above the locked level, and triangular fractures of the anterosuperior corner of the inferior vertebral body.\n\nA second type of unstable hyperflexion C-spine injury is the flexion teardrop fracture, which typically results from the combination of flexion and axial loading.  This injury manifests radiographically as an anteroinferior (teardrop) fracture fragment of a lower cervical vertebra (most commonly C5).  The teardrop fragment may be large and frequently retains anatomic alignment with the adjacent inferior vertebral body or shows minimal anterior and downward displacement, while the larger posterior fragment shows posterior displacement relative to the vertebra below.  Frequently, concomitant sagittal fractures through the vertebral body and laminae (associated with axial loading) are also present.\n \n=============== ADDITIONAL PEARLS:  \n\nIf the flexion force is associated with a rotational component, either a unilateral perched facet or a unilateral locked facet may result..  This category of C-spine injuries accounts for approximately 12% of the total.\n\nThe other C-spine hyperflexion injuries are: anterior subluxation, vertebral compression, flexion teardrop fracture, and spinous process (clay shoveler\u2019s) fracture.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"flexion injuriesjumped facetslocked facets","Reference":"McCort JJ, ed.

Enchondromas are usually singular, but multiple lesions may occur in enchondromatosis syndromes such as Ollier\u2019s, Maffucci\u2019s and metachondromatosis.  Enchondromas are a benign finding seen incidentally on plain radiographs MRI, and\/or CT while investigating other pathology.\n\nTypically, patients are 20-40 years old when the tumor is identified.  The patient with any of the enchondromatosis syndromes is typically younger when the first lesion is identified. There is no gender or racial predilection.\n\nIn the United States, enchondromas account for 12-14% of benign bone neoplasms and 3-10% of osseous neoplasms in general. They are most commonly found in the diaphyses of the hands and feet, and less commonly in the femur, humerus, or tibia.  Enchondromas present as small (<5 cm) lytic masses which have a pattern of lobulated arcs and rings indicative of their chondroid matrix.  When found in the larger bones, they are usually metaphyseal, centrally located and can have a sclerotic margin.\n\nFrequently plain radiographs are adequate to identify and diagnose enchondromas.  Occasionally, further imaging such as CT or MRI may be required to offer a more complete picture of the bone surrounding the tumor.  Bone scans are usually ineffective in the diagnosis of enchondromas as typical findings of mildly increased uptake are non-specific.\n\nEnchondromas are benign but can cause pathologic fractures or can rarely progress to chondrosarcoma. This malignant transformation is of concern due to the destructive changes which occur in high grade tumors as well as the 5 year survival rate which is as low as 15% in high grade tumors.   \n\nTumors found in the hands and feet have a virtually negligible transformation rate while those seen in the long and flat bones should be monitored more closely for transformation. Transformation to malignancy occurs much more frequently in patients with enchondromatosis. \n\nThe following radiographic changes are suggestive of this transformation to chondrosarcoma:\n\u2022 \tScalloping of the inner surface of the bone\n\u2022 \tThickening of the bone cortex\n\u2022 \tReactive bone growth on the outer surface of the bone\n\u2022 \tErosion surrounded by reactive bone\n\u2022 \tNoticeable growth in the bony erosion\n\u2022 \tMRI may identify cortical extension and extension to the soft tissue mass.\n\nWith the exception of enlarged digits when hands and feet are involved, physical exam of the patient with an enchondroma is usually unremarkable. Pain found on exam is attributable to either adjacent but non-related pathology, pathologic fracture resulting from the enchondroma, or should raise the clinical suspicion for progression to chondrosarcoma.\n\nDifferential diagnosis varies depending on whether calcifications are present.  In cases in which they are, bone infarct which may exhibit a serpiginous lining and low grade chondrosarcoma must be considered.  If the lesion is purely lytic, however, non-ossifying fibroma, simple bone cyst, fibrous dysplasia, eosinophilic granuloma, and clear cell chondrosarcoma should be considered. \nWhen considering these diagnoses, the following factors are each used to rule out the diagnosis in question:\n\u2022 \tNon-ossifying fibroma \u2013 usually cortically based, enchondromas are medullary based\n\u2022 \tSimple bone cyst \u2013 usually seen before age 20\n\u2022 \tEosinophilic granuloma \u2013 also seen commonly in patients before age 20\n\u2022 \tFibrous dysplasia \u2013 has a ground glass appearance on imaging\n\u2022 \tClear cell chondrosarcoma \u2013 epiphyseally based, with extension into the metaphysis usually seen on MR\n\nWhen asymptomatic, treatment of enchondromas consists of observation.

It is a nonhereditary disorder of unknown cause. \n\nIn fibrous dysplasia, the medullary bone is replaced by fibrous tissue, which appears radiolucent on radiographs, with the classically described ground-glass appearance. Trabeculae of woven bone contain fluid-filled cysts that are embedded largely in collagenous fibrous matrix, which contributes to the generalized hazy appearance of the bone. Fibrous dysplasia was found to affect males and females equally, but it was 50% more prevalent in the maxilla. \n\nThe following 4 disease patterns are recognized: Monostotic form, Polyostotic form, Craniofacial form and Cherubism\n\nMonostotic Fibrous Dysplasia. Approximately 70-80% of fibrous dysplasias are monostotic. This form most frequently occurs in the rib (28%), femur (23%), tibia or craniofacial bones (10-25%), humerus, and vertebrae, in decreasing order of frequency.\n\nThis form may present with pain or a pathologic fracture in patients aged 10-70 years, but this form most frequently occurs in those aged 10-30 years. The degree of bone deformity of the monostotic form is relatively less severe than that of the polyostotic type. No clearly documented evidence supports conversion of the monostotic form to the polyostotic form.\n\nFibrous dysplasia may be associated with endocrinopathies in 2-3% of cases; these include precocious puberty in girls, hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, acromegaly, diabetes mellitus, and Cushing syndrome. McCune-Albright syndrome may be associated with hyperthyroidism and, hence, exophthalmos.\n\nRadiological findings:\nThe usual appearance of fibrous dysplasia includes a lucent lesion in the diaphysis or metaphysis, with endosteal scalloping and with or without bone expansion and the absence of periosteal reaction. Usually, the matrix of the lucency is smooth and relatively homogeneous; classically, this finding is described as a ground-glass appearance. Irregular areas of sclerosis may be present with or without calcification. The lucent lesion has a thick sclerotic border and is called the rind sign.\n\nFollow-up:\nMalignant degeneration, Estimated frequency is 0.4-1%.\nThe interval from the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia to the development of malignancy varies and is usually years or decades.\nMost often, skull and facial bones undergo malignant change in monostotic disease, whereas femoral and facial bones undergo malignant change in polyostotic disease.\nOsteosarcoma and fibrosarcoma are the most common tumors. Chondrosarcomas occur less frequently.\nRadiographic features suggestive of malignant degeneration include a rapid increase in the size of the lesion and a change from a previously mineralized bony lesion to a lytic lesion. Clinical findings of increasing pain and an enlarging soft-tissue mass suggest malignant change.\n\nMetabolic changes, Hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalacia have been noted in patients with fibrous dysplasia. \nOne hypothesis to explain the associated metabolic disorder suggests that lesions such as fibrous dysplasia synthesize phosphaturic hormone.","External Links":"emedicine.medscape.com\/article\/389714-overview","Keywords":"Polyostotic Fibrous DysplasiaFibrous DysplasiaRind Sign","Reference":"Kumar Neelala Anand, Mahesh.

Patients with BAV are at increased risk for a variety of complications that includes aortic valvular disease, endocarditis, ascending aortic aneurysm and aortic dissection [1-4].  There is also an association of BAV with coarctation of the aorta [5,6].  While this BAV-coarctation relationship is widely known to exist in patients with Turner syndrome, this is also seen in non-syndromic individuals.  \n\nThe detection of a bicuspid aortic valve is often incidental, but once found requires routine surveillance for its associated complications.  Echocardiography remains the initial study of choice for most patients.  However, MRI, capable of functional evaluation using cine bright blood techniques and of aortography using MRA, is well suited for further evaluation of patients with BAV for associated valvular and aortic conditions.\n\nFunctional impairment of the aortic valve\u2014namely aortic stenosis and aortic regurgitation\u2014is the most common complication (in up to 68-85% of patients [1,3]) seen in patients with BAV.  Aortic stenosis may manifest as a systolic ejection murmur, best heard in the second right intercostal space.  Aortic insufficiency, on the other hand, is characterized by a decrescendo diastolic murmur, best heard at the left sternal border.  On echocardiography, of course, the severity of the valvular stenosis or insufficiency and co-existence of a BAV is typically evident.  \n\nPatients with BAV also have an increased incidence of aortic disease [7-11].  While it is well known that aortic valvular dysfunction is associated with increased risk for aortic aneurysm, patients with BAV appear to have additional risks for aortic disease.  Nistri et al. [12] reported significant aortic root enlargement in healthy patients with normally functioning BAV when compared to healthy subjects with normally functioning tricuspid aortic valves.  Similarly, Hahn et al. [2] report significantly larger aortic root sizes in patients with BAV at all grades of valvular dysfunction when compared to subjects with tricuspid aortic valves matched for age, gender and grade of valvular disease.  These studies suggest that the predisposition for aortic disease in patients with BAV is due to factors other than, or in addition to, traditional hemodynamic considerations.  \n\nDe Sa et al. [8] and others [7,9,11] have reported severe degenerative changes, such as cystic medial necrosis, elastic fragmentation and alterations of smooth muscle orientation, in the media of the ascending aorta of patients with BAV.  Moreover, de Sa et al [8] found more severe degenerative changes not only in the media of the ascending aorta but also in the pulmonary arteries of patients with BAV, compared to that of patients with tricuspid aortic valves.  These studies suggest that the association of BAV with aortic disease results from a common developmental error and not only hemodynamic forces.  \n\nIn patients with aortic dilatation and BAV, the risk for aortic rupture and aortic dissection are considerably higher [13].  The risk for aortic dissection, in particular, has been reported to be increased 5 to 9 fold in patients with BAV [10,14].  For this reason, some surgeons have advocated more aggressive and earlier elective surgical repair in patients with BAV, aortic valvular dysfunction and aortic dilation [13].  \n\nThe clinical presentation of patients with BAV varies and depends on the presence and severity of its associated complications.  Often the finding is incidental, such as being found during a routine echocardiogram for evaluation of suspected aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency.  On occasion, it is identified during the evaluation of a dilated aorta as in this case.  Alegret et al. [15] reported BAV in 20 percent of their patients with aortic root dilatation.  Echocardiography will continue to be the initial study of choice in most instances.  However, with the increased use of MRI in the evaluation of aortic pathology, the evaluation of the aortic valve should be considered during an MRI study especially in instances of aortic dilatation or in cases where there is suspicion or known aortic valvular dysfunction.  \n\nOn MRI, aortic caliber is best evaluated using ECG-gated black blood pulse sequences (Figures A-D).  Note that these images are typically performed during diastole and measurements may not necessarily correlate exactly with echocardiographic measurements.  The aortic valve, on the other hand, is best seen using cine bright blood acquisitions, notably steady state free precession (SSFP; also known as TrueFISP, FIESTA and balanced FFE).  To evaluate valvular function, cine images should be performed perpendicular to the left ventricular outflow track (Figure E).  To evaluate the number of valve leaflets, imaging using cine SSFP (or cine phase contrast, Figure F) images should be performed parallel to the aortic valve plane.  The determination of BAV is made by the configuration of blood flow across the actual aortic valve.  In patients with BAV, the aortic valve orifice is shaped like a lens (Figure F); in patients with a tricuspid aortic valve, like a triangle.  \n\nMRI is well suited for the determination of aortic caliber and valvular pathology, but can also reliably detect aortic dissection [16].  This can be performed using a combination of black and bright blood pulse sequences.

They exhibit rapid growth, and frequently lead to hydocephalus.  These tumors have a tendency to spread via the subarachnoid spaces.  Up to 50% of patients will have CSF metastases at the time of diagnosis.  These can be found within the ventricular system and in the thecal sac of the spinal canal.  It is imperative that MR evaluation ot the spinal canal with gadolinium be performed prior to surgery.  Metastases appear as brightly enhancing foci studding the meninges.  After surgery, postoperative changes may become enhanced and might be indistinguishable from metastases.  Systemic metastases also occur, with the skeleton being the most common site. Skeletal metastases may be desmoplastic and sclerotic. The 5 year survival rate is 50% - 86% with combination chemo-radiation therapy.\n\nOn CT, medulloblastomas are ususally midline, solid hyperdense masses.  Small (< 10mm) cystic changes can be seen in up to 50 percent, and calcification occurs in up to 20 %.  Hydrocephalus is present in 90 %.

The musculoskeletal fibromatoses are a diverse group of diseases with a common histopathologic appearance being composed of spindle-shaped fibrous cells separated by abundant collagen material with few mitoses whose behavior varies between benign fibrous lesions and fibrosarcoma.  The fibromatoses are separated into superficial - (palmar \u2013 aka Dupuytren disease, plantar, juvenile aponeurotic fibroma, infantile digital fibromatosis) which are usually small, slow growing lesions which arise from fascia\/aponeuroses and deep-(infantile myofibromatosis, fibromatosis colli, extraabdominal desmoid tumor, and aggressive infantile fibromatosis) which arise from the deeper musculoaponeuroses and are larger and may grow rapidly.  Both forms have a tendency to recur following excision.\n\tPlantar fibromatosis, like all fibromatoses, are three to four times more common in males.  It occurs between the ages of 30 \u2013 50 and is seen bilaterally in 20-50% of cases.  It is associated with palmar fibromatosis 10-65% of the time.  The fibromas are most commonly seen on the medial aspect of the plantar aponeurosis.  The lesions are often asymptomatic.  Surgery is performed utilizing large margins.  Post-surgical radiation treatment may decrease recurrence.\n\tThe typical appearance of plantar fibromatosis on MR is a poorly defined, infiltrative mass in the aponeurosis next to the plantar muscles.  They are typically heterogeneously low signal when compared to muscle on both T1 and T2.  Lesions which have an increased T2 signal have more cellularity and are more likely to recur, therefore, some surgeons may postpone resection until the lesion is more fibrous (ie. Low T2 signal).  Enhancement following gadolinium administration is variable.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"fibromatosisplantar","Reference":"Robbin MR,   Murphey MD.  Imaging of Musculoskeletal Fibromatosis.

They often present with symptoms of hydrocephalus (e.g. headache, vomiting and vertigo), cranial nerve or cerebellar symptoms (e.g. ataxia).  Obstruction of the fourth ventricle leading to hydrocephalus is not uncommon.  Cerebellar signs may be unilateral or axial depending on involvement of the vermis or a single hemisphere.  Astrocytomas and medulloblastomas are the most common posterior fossa tumors in children and present with similar frequency.  Ependymomas and hemangioblastomas are also commonly seen.\n\nAstrocytomas are common in children but are not uncommon in adults.  The incidence is similar between male and female, with perhaps a slight female predominance.  Pilocytic astrocytomas are, by definition, low-grade (WHO grade I) tumors.  They are well circumscribed lesions and may be cystic, solid or both.  The cystic form is seen in greater than 75% of lesions and has a classic appearance of a mural nodule in a cyst.  With MRI, the mural tumor appears iso- or hypointense on T1-weighted images and iso- to hyperintense on T2-weight images.  The cyst wall does not consist of tumor cells and thus will not enhance on CT or MRI.  Complete resection is often curative, however solid tumors may not be as amenable to resection if the fourth ventricle is involved.\n\nMedulloblastoma, a primitive neuroectodermal tumor, is rare in adulthood, most commonly occurring between ages 5 and 15 with a 2:1 male predominance.  These highly malignant tumors usually arise in the midline in the posterior fossa (85%).  Medulloblastoma appears hypointense on T1, hyperintense on T2 and enhances with contrast.  It may appear well-circumscribed but is often found to be invasive at the margins on histology, often invades the fourth ventricle and will seed the subarachnoid space \u2013 necessitating surveillance of the spinal cord.  Death usually comes within months if not treated.  Resection, chemotherapy and radiation can extend life, with 60-75% survival at five years.\n\nHemangioblastomas are benign, low-grade (WHO grade I) tumors that are associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease, but also occur in isolation.  They have a very similar appearance on MRI to astrocytomas, consisting of a cyst with mural module, but may also be solid or multiple with von Hippel-Lindau.  The mural nodule enhances and has classic flow and enhancement features on angiography.  As with pilocytic astrocytoma complete resection is often curative, however recurrence is not uncommon.\n\nEpendymomas most commonly arise in the floor of the fourth ventricle.  This is a malignant tumor that can spread throughout the ventricular system.  This mass can be differentiated from the others discussed here as it often has calcifications on CT.  Complete resection is rarely achievable, but these are usually radiosensitive.  On MRI, ependymomas may appear as multiple small cysts that enhance with contrast.\n\nMRI is the leading diagnostic and surveillance modality for posterior fossa tumors.

A bone biopsy is a surgical procedure, is time consuming and not without risk, and is expensive, whereas imaging is essentially noninvasive, provides rapid results with very little risk to the patient, and relative to surgery is inexpensive.  Therefore, it is the modality used to make a diagnosis in these patients, although biopsy is occasionally needed for confirmation, particularly when patients have neuropathic joints and osteomyelitis.\n\nRadiographs of the foot are the easiest and least expensive imaging studies.1  However, \u201cthe sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of osteomyelitis of the diabetic foot are 60% and 66% respectively.\u201d1  Unfortunately, osteomyelitis must be present for 10 to 21 days before the infection is detectable on plain radiographs and a patient with severe neuropathic bone disease will have a similar appearing study.1  However, radiographs should be the initial imaging study, not only due to its ease and economy, but also as a baseline.\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test for diagnosing osteomyelitis with a sensitivity and specificity of 99% and 83% respectively and demonstrates excellent contrast between the soft tissues and bones and pathological conditions such as osteomyelitis, myositis, and cellulitis.1  The main drawback of MRI in this role is cost.1  On T1-weighted MR images of the bone marrow, osteomyelitis causes a decreased signal intensity, but T2-weighted MR images with fat saturation and short tau inversion recovery (STIR) MR images of involved bone marrow will show an increased signal intensity.1,3  On contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MR images with fat saturation, areas of osteomyelitis will enhance.  MRI can also detect the diabetic ulceration, and sometimes the sinus tract from osteomyelitis to ulcer.  The addition of contrast-enhanced MRI allows the detection of nonenhancing necrosis, which is important to recognize for debridement.\n\n1. Schinabeck MK, Johnson JL.

Microbes can reach bone by three mechanisms: hematogenous spread, extension from a contiguous site of infection, and direct introduction of organisms into bone by trauma and surgery.  \n\nAcute hematogenous osteomyelitis involves bone with red marrow.  In children, most commonly affected are the long bones with relatively slow flow in metaphyseal sinusoidal veins and a paucity of phagocytes.  Infection is often secondary to staphylococcal skin infections.  In adults, acute osteo rarely involves the long bones because adipose tissue has replaced red marrow.  Instead, it most commonly occurs in vertebral bodies, where the marrow is cellular and has abundant vascular supply.  Septicemia is usually the inciting event.\n\nExtension from a contiguous site of infection is a common cause for osteomyelitis.  Infection following trauma, radiation therapy, burns or pressure sores.  In patients with vascular insufficiency, organisms can enter the soft tissues through a cutaneous ulcer, often in the foot, and cause cellulitis, then osteomyelitis.\n\nDirect introduction of organisms into the bone may occur during open fractures, open surgical reduction of closed fractures, or penetrating trauma by foreign bodies such as bullets.  May also arise from perioperative  contamination of bone during laminectomy, diskectomy, or joint prosthesis.  The causitive organism is typically normal flora, such as Staph Epidermidis.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"osteomyelitisbone scanindium","Reference":"Nuclear Medicine, The Requisites  Copyright 2001, Mosby, Inc.","Title":"Osteomyelitis"}}

The most common long-term sequelae of PCA strokes are visual and sensory deficits.  In general, patients with PCA distribution strokes exhibit less overall chronic disability than those with anterior cerebral, middle cerebral, or basilar artery infarctions.\n\nIschemic strokes occur when blood cannot flow to cerebral structures.  Neuron metabolism tolerates a brief period of interrupted oxygen and glucose delivery.  Cell death is imminent after approximately 6 minutes of halted blood circulation.  Large cortical neurons are especially sensitive to ischemia.  Infarcts include a central area, or umbra, of highly concentrated cell death, surrounded by a penumbra of tissue containing stunned cells that may recover, assuming circulation is reestablished or produced through nearby collaterals.\n\nThe right and left PCA vessels are formed from bifurcation of the basilar artery near the junction of the pons and midbrain over the ventral aspect of the brainstem and each PCA is divided into four segments (P1-P4)\nP1: extends from origin of the PCA to the posterior communicating artery (PCOM)\nP2: includes from junction with PCOM to its major branch, the lateral posterior choroidal artery, which supplies the posterior thalamus\nP3\/P4: distal segments of the PCA whose branches circulate blood to cortical regions, most importantly the undersurface of the temporal lobe, the posterior 1\/3 of the interhemispheric surface, occipital pole, visual cortex, and splenium of the corpus callosum.\n\nAnatomic localization of the point of vascular occlusion in the PCA infarcts may be simplified into (1) DEEP or PROXIMAL PCA strokes, causing ischemia in the thalamus and\/or midbrain (regions supplied by P1 and P2), as well as in the cortex (regions supplied by P3 and P4); and (2) SUPERFICIAL or DISTAL PCA strokes, involving only cortical structures (P3,P4 branch areas)\n\nPatients with PCA infarcts present with symtptoms such as:\n- acute vision loss\n- confusion\n- new onset posterior cranium headache\n- paresthesias\n- limb weakness\n- dizziness\n- nausea\n- memory loss\n- language dysfunction\n\nThe most common examination finding is a homonymous visual field cut, usually a complete hemianopia, caused by a lesion in the contralateral occipital lobe.\n\nDeep or proximal PCA infarcts involve portions of the thalamus and midbrain.  Thalamic lesions result in contralateral face and limb sensory loss.  The midbrain cerebral peduncle carries corticospinal tract fibers that decussate caudally in the brainstem.  A peduncle lesion is associated with contralateral motor weakness.  Large or bilateral PCA infarcts that involve thalamus, temporal, and\/or parietal-occipital lobes often result in a spectrum of possible findings (neuropsychologic deterioration and memory, language, or visual-cognitive dysfunction)\n\nMajor etiologies of PCA infarction include cardiac embolism, vertebrobasilar disease, and PCA atherothrombosis.\n\nhttp:\/\/rad.usuhs.mil\/medpix\/medpix.html?mode=single&recnum=3748&table=card&search=vascular+map#top\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Display&dopt=pubmed_pubmed&from_uid=10773642","External Links":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/query.fcgi?db=PubMed&cmd=Display&dopt=pubmed_pubmed&from_uid=10773642","Keywords":"strokeinfarct","Reference":"1) Hasso AN, Stringer WA, Brown KD: Cerebral Ischemia and Infarction.

These tumors manifest in the fourth decade and 1\/3 of patients have von Hippel-Lindau disease.  They often present as intramedullary cysts with one or more vascular nodules and dilated, tortuous veins usually on the dorsal surface of the cord, seen on angiography.  About 40% of all hemangioblastomas and 60% of intramedullary hemangioblastomas are associated with a syrinx.\n\nMR findings typically show an enlarged, sometimes irregular widening of the cord that is predominately hypointense on T1WI and becomes hyperintense on T2WI.  This is due to the cystic component, which is also indistinguishable from the surrounding edema on T2WI.  The tumor nidus may sometimes be seen as isointense (to cord), nodular on T1- weighted sequence within the intramedullary or intradural cystic cavity, but becoming hyperintense on T2WI (usually indistinguishable from the cystic cavity or surrounding edema).  An associated syrinx may be quite extensive, extending over multiple levels above and below the tumor.  Reports have shown that the tumor nidus rapidly and intensely enhances on T1WI following the administration of gadopentetate dimeglumine, helping to demarcate the tumor from the surrounding edema, thus providing valuable preoperative localization.  Additionally, focal areas of signal void on both T1- and T2WI may be seen, depicting the flow in dilated feeding\/draining vessels.

However, up to 25% of cases can be missed without imaging.  Physical exam findings include tenderness in the region of the tendon, positive Thompson test (absent plantar flexion on squeezing of the calf), or a palpable focal cleft at the insertion of the tendon.  Imaging diagnosis is made either at MRI or sonography.  With MRI, an intact tendon should have low signal intensity in all sequences.  Increased intensity in any sequence is consistent with a tear in the tendon or tendonitis.  Partial or complete disruption of the fibers is diagnostic for a tear in the tendon.  With sonography the intact tendon has homogeneous low-level echoes oriented lengthwise along the tendon.  Complete tears are characterized by discontinuity of the tendon, often with fluid in the gap and variable irregular echogenicity of Kager\u2019s fat pad due to hemorrhage and edema.

Chronic hypernatremia should be corrected slowly due to the risk of brain edema which may lead to brain herniation, permanent neurologic deficits and lysis of myelin. In this case, the time course of the hypernatremia was unknown. Typical presentation is usually neurologic deterioration 48-72 hours after the sodium level has been corrected. Pseudobulbar palsy and spastic quadriplegia are two of the physical findings often associated with the syndrome.   There is a large spectrum of outcomes ranging from complete recovery to a total \u201clocked in\u201d state which may progress to coma and even death. \n\n\nReferences:\n1.\tDiagnostic imaging: Brain.

This may  be  seen  in  patients  with  alcohol  abuse,  liver  disease,  burns,  cancer,  sepsis,  and  anorexia.    Patients  may  present  with  spastic  quadriparesis  and  cranial  nerve  paresis.    The  level  of  consciousness  may  range  from  normal  to  coma.   \n\nUsually blamed on \"osmotic stress\" - the  rapid  correction  of  hyponatremia  appears  to  play  an  important  role  with  some  descriptions  of  the  disease  portraying  it  as  an  osmotic  demyelination  syndrome.  However, there are cases which have had relatively normal sodium values.  PMID: 17462902\n\nRecovery  may  be  variable.    CPM  may  be  more  common  than  previously  recognized  with  mild,  clinically  undetected  cases  found  at  autopsy.\n\nDifferential considerations for the central pontine lesions include: pontine  glioma (astrocytoma), hemangioblastoma, ischemic changes, herniation syndromes, multiple sclerosis, and central pontine myelinolysis.  Without  mass effect the first two choices are less likely.  An acute clinical history and an absent normal basilar artery flow void would suggest pontine infarction.  Multiple  sclerosis  will  usually  exhibit  additional  characteristic  lesions - typically in the cerebral hemispheric white matter, especially along the margins of the lateral ventricles.","External Links":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/sites\/entrez?Db=pubmed&DbFrom=pubmed&Cmd=Link&LinkName=pubmed_pubmed&LinkReadableName=Related%20Articles&IdsFromResult=17462902&ordinalpos=1&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum","Keywords":"sodiumhyponatremiaiatrogenic","Reference":"http:\/\/www.emedicine.com\/NEURO\/topic50.htm\nPMID: 17462902\nPMID: 11148672\nhttp:\/\/content.nejm.org\/cgi\/content\/extract\/333\/19\/1259","Title":"Osmotic Myelinolysis, Central Pontine Myelinolysis"}}

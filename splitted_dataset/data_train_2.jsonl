These lesions typically present in young adults in the  2nd to 5th   decade   with   complaints  referable  to  acute  or  chronic hydrocephalus.  Other symptoms include ataxia, memory disturbances, and gait disorders.    The  cyst  contents  include  secretory  and breakdown  products  of the epithelial lining tissue, including hemorrhage, lipid (cholesterol), hemosiderin, and CSF.  \n\nOn  T1-weighted MR images, these cysts vary widely from hypo- to hyperintense in comparison to normal brain.  Although they may be bright on T2-weighted images, moderate  to  marked hypointensity  is  common and has been attributed to a very  short  T1  relaxation  time  or  to  magnetic susceptibility effect from paramagnetic substances in the cyst.  On noncontrast  MR,  these lesions occasionally are indistinguishable by intensity from neoplasia; however, the absence  of  enhancement, classic location,  and  relative hypointensity  on  T2-weighted studies should suggest this diagnosis.  Treatment is variable, including  ventricular  shunting alone, stereotactic cyst drainage, or surgical resection.\n\nOn  noncontrast CT, colloid cysts are solitary, round to oval, usually hyperdense masses at the foramen of Monro  with  associated enlargement  of  one or both lateral ventricles (Film .3).  Minimal or absent contrast enhancement is typical.  Moderate  enhancement with  contrast  suggests  a  different  etiology,  such  as glioma, craniopharyngioma, choroid plexus papilloma,  or  remotely  meningioma.

More about general treatment for NF1 patients will be discussed in the discussion.  As for her specific findings on this CT study, treatment and follow-up are as follows:\n\nPlexiform neurofibroma:  Lesions usually involve multiple nerve fascicles with significant vascularity. Thus, surgical excision is generally difficult and frustrating, with excessive bleeding and a poor cosmetic result. Repeated debulking may be necessary for severe symptoms, and orbital evisceration for extensive cases. Radiotherapy offers no benefit. However, farnesyl transferase inhibitors, which inhibit growth of these tumors in animals, are a possible treatment in the future and are currently undergoing clinical trials.  Of concern, there is a small risk of malignant transformation of these tumors. They may occasionally erode into the anterior cranial fossa, which results in death.\n\nOptic nerve glioma:  The radiologist of this case recommended further evaluation with MRI of the brain and orbits. If the MRI is positive for an optic nerve glioma, MRI and an ophthalmic exam are repeated every 3-6 months. Otherwise, if vision is ok, observation is the treatment. If the tumor progresses, the child should be referred to neurooncology for evaluation.  Surgical excision is offered if a tumor approaches the chiasm. Surgery also is indicated for pain or disfiguring proptosis. The role of radiotherapy remains controversial; it may be associated with CNS complications.

It is an autosomal dominant disorder with an incidence of 1 in 3000.  It involves chromosome 17, which encodes for the protein neurofibromin, which is expressed in many tissues including brain, kidney, spleen, and thymus.  Mutations leading to loss of function of this protein results in a wide spectrum of clinical findings.\n\nDiagnostic criteria were developed in 1987 by the NIH Consensus Conference (updated in 1997) and are based on clinical features. Two of the following must be present to diagnose as NF1:  6 or more caf?-au-lait macules (>5mm-prepuberty or >15mm-postpuberty), 2 or more neurofibromas of any type or 1 plexiform neurofibroma, freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions, optic glioma, 2 or more Lisch nodules, distinctive bony lesion (i.e. sphenoid dysplasia, thinning of long bone cortex with or without pseudoarthrosis), a first degree relative diagnosed with NF1.\n\nOptic nerve glioma is a pilocytic astrocytoma that primarily affects children. The lesion may be bilateral in NF1 (29% of optic gliomas are associated with NF1).  Clinical findings include gradual loss of vision, optic atrophy or edema, and exophthalmos. Eighty percent of patients experience an initial decrease in vision which then stabilizes. Hypothalamic signs, to include precocious or delayed puberty, may be seen in 22% of cases. Prognosis for vision is poor. Lesions initially confined to the optic nerve have a mortality of 10%. Lesions involving the chiasm have a mortality of 20%. With midbrain and hypothalamus involvement, the prognosis is poor, with mortality greater than 55%.\n\nPlexiform neurofibroma is the most common benign peripheral nerve tumor in the eyelid and orbit. The tumor grows along the nerve, is not encapsulated, and is invasive. Children in the first decade of life are most commonly affected. The tumor tends to grow along sensory nerves, but also may involve motor, parasympathetic, and sympathetic nerves.  Thirty one percent of plexiform neurofibromas occur in the eyelids.  The clinical description of this tumor is as a palpable \u201cbag of worms,\u201d with thickened overlying skin and an S-shaped eyelid.

Current recommendations are based on numerous studies, such as the PIOPED study.  Imaging modalities vary and can be situation or institution dependent.  The initial work-up for a pt suspected of having a pulmonary embolism involves a CXR in order to rule out other pulmonary or cardiac findings, such as a pneumothorax, pneumonia, or rib fracture.  If the CXR is non diagnostic, other imaging modalities include V\/Q scan, helical CT with PE protocol, pulmonary angiography, echocardiography, or venous US of the lower extremities.  The gold standard is generally thought to be pulmonary angiography.      There are advantages and disadvantages to each modality.  CXR is rarely diagnostic of PE, nor does it often show the classic findings (Hampton\u2019s hump, Westermark\u2019s sign).  However, it can be useful for ruling out other pathology.  The most common findings on CXR in pt\u2019s with PE include atelectasis, pleural effusions, infiltrates, and elevation of the hemidaphragm.      V\/Q scans also are rarely diagnostic.   The scans can be difficult to interpret and often meaningless if there is other underlying pulmonary pathology.  Additionally, the diagnosis of PE was highly dependent on the clinical suspicion of the physician.           More recently, helical CT has been used to aid in diagnosing PE.  Disadvantages include poor visualization of the periphery of the lungs at the subsegmental level.  The main advantage is the relative ease of the procedure and the decreased variable of reader interpretation (when compared to V\/Q scans).      As previously stated, pulmonary angiography continues to be the gold standard for diagnosing pulmonary emboli.  However, these studies are slightly more invasive than other modalities and can carry up to a 0.5% risk of mortality.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"PulmonaryEmbolism","Reference":"Pulmonary Thromboembolism, Samuel Z.

The clinical diagnosis of pulmonary embolism is unreliable. Symptoms of PE include tachypnea\/dyspnea (most common), tachycardia, hypoxia, pleuritic chest pain, hemoptysis, syncope, and atrial fibrillation. Blood gas may be normal. \n\nThe D-dimer blood test is a screening tool for pulmonary embolism. A serum level less than 500 ng\/L excludes pulmonary embolism with a 90% accuracy. A positive test is non-specific. Additionally, the test is unreliable in the presence of malignancy, sepsis, recent surgery, or trauma. \n\nThe source is  most commonly from deep venous thrombosis in the lower extremity,  however, about 10% arise from clot in the upper extremity.  Risk factors are  Immobilization, Recent Surgery, Underlying Malignancy, History of Deep Venous Thrombosis or Pulmonary Embolism, Estrogen use, or Pre-existing cardiac disease. A low percentage of cases of pulmonary embolism result in pulmonary infarction, due to the presence of the bronchial circulation. \n\nTreatment for PE most commonly consists of anticoagulation with heparin or coumadin. Anticoagulation prevents clot propagation and allows endogenous fibrinolytic activity to dissolve existing thrombiAnticoagulation decreases mortality form 30-60% to <5%.  \nThrombolytic agents are not routinely used for the treatment of acute PE. Thrombolytic treatment is generally reserved for patients with massive pulmonary embolism producing circulatory shock (hypotension).\n\nFor patients that cannot be anticoagulated, an inferior vena caval filter can be placed in order to prevent life-threatening PE. Major complications occur in about 1% of cases. Complications include central migration of the filter, filter fracture, inferior vena caval perforation, and vena caval thrombosis.\nV\/Q scanning has been the mainstay for screening symptomatic patients for the presence of pulmonary embolism. A negative V\/Q scan essentially excludes PE, and a high probability study is associated with the presence of a PE in about 85% of cases at angiography. Confusion arises with low or intermediate probability examinations, and there is common disagreement among expert readers in the interpretation of scans in these categories. The problem with V\/Q scanning is that it does not directly visualize thromboembolism, but rather its effects on perfusion and ventilation . This problem causes the need for probability criteria, which in turn causes confusing results.  Nuclear medicine scanning for PE is probably most useful in previously healthy patients with a normal chest radiograph.   As the complexity of the patients underlying cardiopulmonary disease increases, so does the likelihood that the scan will not be informative (intermediate probability). Using PIOPED criteria, intermediate probability V\/Q scans occurred in 60% of patients with COPD, but in only 13% of patients with normal CXR's. However, a generalized abnormality on CXR such as diffuse pulmonary edema or reticulonodular disease may not cause the perfusion lung scan to be abnormal.\n\nThe CXR is abnormal in the majority of cases of PE. The PIOPED study showed that among patients with angiographically proven pulmonary embolism, only 12% had chest X-rays interpreted as normal.  (24% of patients with PE in another study had normal CXR's ). Atelectasis and other focal pulmonary parenchymal abnormalities are the most common CXR findings in pulmonary embolism, occurring in up to 68% of patients with PE.  Pleural effusions are also common but usually small and  unilateral. Other palin film findings indicative of PE include regional oligemia (Westermark sign), a pleural-based wedge shaped area of increased opacity (Hampton's hump), and prominence of the central pulmonary artery with abrupt tapering (Knuckle sign).\n\nIn pulmonary angiography,an embolus classiclally produces a filling defect within the affected pulmonary artery. Non-occlusive emboli have a \"tram-track\" appearance. Although considered the gold standard, angiography may not always detect the presence of emboli. Some indirect angiographic evidence for the presence of emboli such as vascular pruning and delayed capillary blush are non-specific. Additionally, agreement among angiographers regarding the presence of subsegmental emboli is poor  and can be as low as 15%. V\/Q scans can provide a road map to angiography, but if the abnormally perfused segment on the V\/Q scan appears normal at angiography, complete evaluation the remainder of the lungs for the presence of pulmonary emboli is warranted. One important point to remember is that a negative angiogram has been shown to be an excellent indicator of a good prognosis. \n\nHelical CT is able to identify main, lobar, and segmental emboli with a reported sensitivity over 90%. Although the detection of subsegmental emboli is worse, the clinical significance of these small emboli has not yet been establishished. Additionally, on angiography there is poor interobserver agreement for the presence of subsegmental emboli  and the true incidence of isolated subsegmental emboli is difficult to determine. Helical CT has also been shown to have a significantly better sensitivity, specificity, positive, and negative predictive values compared to V\/Q scanning . Helical CT permits a more confident diagnosis to be made in a greater number of cases when compared with V\/Q scanning . \n\nIt has been suggested that helical or electron beam CT should be the initial imaging modality to screen patients suspected of having PE- particularly in patients with abnormal CXR's in whom there is a greater likelihood of inconclusive V\/Q scan results. If emboli are detected, no further work-up is required. If this study is negative, a lower extremity US or CT DVT exam can be performed to assess for the presence of DVT. Again, a positive exam would lead to patient treatment. If both studies were negative, then a decision would be required regarding whether the patient should proceed to angiography or not.  Another benefit of CT is the ability to suggest an alternative diagnosis.","External Links":"www.auntminnie.com","Keywords":"Pulmonay embolismv\/q scanhelical ct","Reference":"Pulmonary embolism revealed on helical CT angiography: comparison with ventilation-perfusion radionuclide lung scanning.

Once an obstruction has occurred, gastric, pancreatic, biliary and small bowel fluid as well as swallowed air will begin to collect proximal to the obstruction dilating the small bowel and causing colicky symptoms.  Distal to the obstruction the bowel contents will empty.  The eventual radiographic picture is that of dilated small bowel with air fluid levels and a preponderance of fluid with little if any gas distal in the small intestine or colon.  If the bowel dilates with air it assumes a step ladder configuration.  Differential air fluid levels within the same intestinal loop can be seen in either an adynamic ileus or a bowel obstruction and are not helpful in distinguishing the two.  The presence of a large amount of fluid is more suggestive of an obstruction.  If small amounts of air are trapped in between the plicae circulares, a line of small round air collections, the \"string of pearls,\" (Film .2Z) can be seen, as in this case.  This finding is indicative of large amounts of fluid and is more suggestive of an obstruction than an adynamic ileus.  The extent of small bowel gas may be a clue as to the site of the obstruction.  Proximal obstructions may result in a fairly benign appearing radiograph.  One third of patients will present with a history and plain film findings sufficiently characteristic that further radiographic work-up is unnecessary.  If a contrast study is performed, barium is the agent of choice because water soluble contrast material becomes too dilute to pin-point a site of obstruction.  Administering the barium through an already indwelling long arm tube or radiographically placed duodenal catheter may be a more expeditious way of pin-pointing the site of a partial obstruction.  With a complete obstruction it is difficult to get the barium column to reach the site of a distal obstruction using any technique without causing the patient either increased discomfort or emesis of the barium.  Many surgeons are content with supportive plain films and clinical history to justify a surgical approach.  \n\nApproximately 60% of mechanical small bowel obstructions occur because of adhesions.  Approximately 20% of obstructions are from hernias, the vast majority of which are external hernias.  Included in this group are inguinal, femoral, umbilical and incisional hernias.  The diagnosis of an incisional hernia can be very difficult and requires oblique views of the abdomen.  Obstructing inguinal hernias in adults are usually symptomatic and readily apparent.  In the neonate, however, an obstructing inguinal hernia may be difficult to diagnose clinically.  A close search for air below the pubic ramus should always be made when a small bowel obstruction is present.  Internal hernias account for less than 5% of obstructing hernias and rarely have a specific enough plain film picture to allow for diagnosis.  \n\nA rounded soft tissue density associated with an obstructed small bowel pattern should always raise the possibility of a closed loop obstruction, representing a twisted or adhesed isolated loop of intestine blocked at both ends.  Other causes of small bowel obstruction include benign or malignant primary tumors, large gallstones, intussusceptions, Crohn's disease, and perforated appendix with abscess formation.\n\nIt should be remembered that the plain film diagnosis of a small bowel obstruction should be made with correlation with the patient's clinical picture.  A single series of films is frequently insufficient and sequential films may be necessary.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"inguinal hernia","Reference":null,"Title":"Small bowel obstruction secondary to adhesions"}}

Initial radiographs of the hips may not show any changes, as in this case.  Therefore, clinical suspicion should be high for this disorder in a patient whose history suggests the diagnosis.  Avascular necrosis is caused by a number of etiologies including femoral neck fracture, alcohol use, sickle cell disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, radiation treatment, and prolonged corticosteroid administration, as in this patient.  Steroids have been implicated in about 20 to 35 percent of cases.  The occurrence also appears to be directly related to the dosage level and duration of the medication.  In decreasing order of frequency, the most common locations of steroid-induced avasular osteonecrosis are the femoral head, humeral head, the distal end of the femur, and the proximal part of the tibia.  \n\nThe pathogenesis of steroid-induced osteonecrosis is unclear.  However several mechanisms have been proposed and include both mechanical and vascular etiologies.  Osteoporosis resulting in microfractures and later bone collapse is one mechanical theory.  Vascular compromise due to hyperviscosity, vasculitis, fat embolization, and compression from marrow accumulation of relatively inelastic fat cells are also other possible causes.\n  \nThe most common presenting symptom of avascular necrosis is pain.  Groin pain and less commonly thigh and buttock pain are seen in patients with femoral head involvement.  Patients may also complain of pain upon weight bearing.  Thirty to fifty percent have bilateral involvement.  Physical exam usually is nonspecific and may demonstrate limited range of motion particularly in abduction and internal rotation.\n\nRadiographic evaluation of a patient with suspected osteonecrosis includes an AP and frog-leg radiograph of both hips.  As mentioned above, the initial radiographs may not show any evidence of disease.  Subsequently, radiographic findings show sclerosis, indistinctive trabecular pattern, and patchy osteoporosis.  Progressive radiograph findings include a crescentic subchondral line indicative of subchondral collapse, segmental flattening of the femoral head, and ultimately joint space narrowing, acetabular degenerative changes, and collapse of the femoral head.\n\nMR imaging is the most sensitive test for detecting avascular necrosis.  As with this patient, MR imaging showed evidence of osteonecrosis prior to the radiographs.  T1-weighted images typically show a line of low signal intensity, which corresponds to the presence of granulation tissue and sclerotic bone.  T2-weighted images typically demonstrate a double line sign, which consists of a narrower line of low signal intensity that corresponds to bone sclerosis and an inner zone of high signal intensity that corresponds to granulation tissue.   \n\nReferences\nLaPorte et al.  \u201cMultifocal Osteonecrosis.\u201d  Journal of Rheumatology.  25(10), Oct 1998, pp 1968-74. \nDonald Resnick.

A nuclear medicine study will help differentiate this lesion from osteomyelitis \u2013 both an osteoid osteoma and osteomyelitis can look identical on plain films and CT.  A bone scan of an osteoid osteoma will demonstrate a \u201cdouble density\u201d sign due to the excessive vascular supply of the nidus.  In contrast, osteomyelitis will be photopenic in the area corresponding to the plain film lucency representing pus and an avascular focus.\n\nIn most instances pain is the only adverse effect of the tumor.  Rarely is there are secondary pathologic consequences in young children with spine or joint oriented tumors.  Because the pain itself can be disabling and spontaneous regression over years is unpredictable, operative treatment is often recommended.  Most recently radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has gained acceptance as the treatment of choice for this condition.  It has replaced open surgery because it has far fewer complications and a much shorter recovery period.  \n\nGenerally this procedure is performed under spinal or local anesthetic and the lesion is identified under CT guidance.  Once the electrode is introduced into the lesion it is heated up to 85-90 degrees Celsius for 6 minutes and then withdrawn.   Patients treated with RFA are usually pain free within 2-3 days and are advised to avoid running or jumping for 3 months.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Osteoid Osteomapainful tumorsrelived by aspirin or NSAIDs","Reference":"1.

Bone lysis can have linear and circular components on radiographs, suggestive of a vascular lesion, with linear and circular elements representing vascular channels seen longitudinally and en face, respectively. However, these serpentine vascular channels are recognized more easily with CT and MR imaging. Characteristically, these channels have low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and very high signal intensity on T2-weighted images because of slow blood flow.

They are the most common childhood tumor, occurring in 12% of children.  They are more common in females, whites, premature infants, and twins.  \n\nAt birth these lesions can be small and inconspicuous, with 60% absent at birth.  The natural history is a two stage process of proliferation and regression.  The typical hemangioma will begin to involute by 10 months of age, with half of all lesions having resolved by 5 years.\n\nClinically, hemangiomas appear as erythematous or blanching macules, or appear as a small telangiectasia.  The clinical appearance depends upon the degree of dermal involvement and lesion depth.  Lesions involving the skin have a more characteristic strawberry appearance.  Deeper lesions demonstrate a blue appearance.  \n\nMost hemangiomas are generally treated conservatively. Corticosteroids are the first line of treatment for problematic infantile capillary hemangiomas.  Other options include interferon alpha and vincristine.  Propranolol has also been observed to inhibit growth. While the mechanism of action is unclear, potential explanations include vasoconstriction; down-regulation of the RAF-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway; and the triggering of apoptosis of capillary endothelial cells. \n\nCapillary hemangiomas can develop life threatening complications, such as consumptive coagulopathy, compression of vital structures, and bleeding secondary to fissure or ulcer formation.","Exam":"Supraclavicular vascular mass with prominent superficial veins.","Findings":"Lobulated, intensely enhancing mass lesion with high flow intralesional vessels.","History":"15 month old baby girl with enlarging right supraclavicular \/ shoulder mass.","Media":null,"Title":"Capillary Hemangioma","Treatment & Follow Up":"This patient was treated with a short course of propranolol with marked interval decrease in the size of the lesion."},"Topic":{"ACR Code":"2.3","Category":"Neoplasm, benign","Disease Discussion":"Overall, hemangiomas are present in 10-12% of Caucasian children - mostly as cutaneous lesions, often called \"strawberry marks\". \n\nIntra orbital vascular lesions account for 5-20% of all orbital masses in children.  Some of these are neoplastic (capillary hemangioma) while others are malformations including venous varices and cavernous hemangioma.  Capillary hemangiomas are composed of variably sized vascular spaces that are lined by proliferating endothelial cells.  Capillary hemangiomas have been reported as the most common vascular tumor of the orbit, representing 5-12% of pediatric orbital lesions.  \n\nMultiple synonyms have been used for these lesions, including infantile hemangioma, benign hemangioendothelioma,  and hemangioblastoma.  However, these terms are neither distinctive nor accurate and the most commonly used term is \u201ccapillary hemangioma\u201d \u2013 to allow distinction from the \u201ccavernous hemangioma\u201d (AKA \u201ccavernoma\u201d, cavernous malformation).  The cavernous hemangioma is one of the most common orbital masses in the adult patient.  The latter process is malformative and not neoplastic. [Mulliken 1982 PMID: 7063565] \n\nOrbital hemangiomas have been reported in association with PHACES (Posterior fossa malformations, Hemangiomas, Arterial anomalies, Cardiac defects and coarctation of the Aorta, Eye abnormalities, and Sternal abnormalities or ventral developmental defects); and also with blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome. [McCannel 1996 PMID: 8643250]\n\nOrbital capillary hemangiomas (OCH) may be supplied either by branches of the internal (e.g. ophthalmic) or external carotid artery, and may extend intracranially through the superior orbital fissure or optic canal.\n\n\u2022  Clinical\nOrbital capillary hemangioma (from now on just \u201chemangioma\u201d) present as sporadic lesions in childhood, with approximately 1\/3 as congenital lesions noted at birth.  The majority will present during the first decade.  Almost half of them may enlarge during a Valsalva maneuver or with crying.  There is a slight female predilection of 3:2 over males vs. up to 3:1 for cutaneous hemangioma.  These endothelial vascular neoplasms typically proliferate in the first few months after presentation; and, then most stabilize \u2013 often at an alarming size.  The natural history in most patients is for the lesions to stabilize for a period of years, and then begin spontaneous involution in adolescence, typically from 4-8 years of age.  Some cases have been followed for up to 18 years, with eventual spontaneous but slow involution. [Henderson JW Ophthalmology 1990 - PMID: 2342808]\n\nIn addition to the obvious facial discoloration and mass, capillary hemangiomas may interfere with vision, cause proptosis, diplopia or amblyopia, and even optic atrophy.  [Yap EY 1998 - PMID: 9703301]\n\n\u2022  Gross Pathology\nThese lesions are usually ruby-red soft, rounded and occasionally lobulated masses.  Lesions with skin or subcutaneous involvement are often called \u201cstrawberry\u201d lesions due to their red color.\n\n\n\u2022  Histology\nThese lesions are usually well demarcated from surrounding tissues.  The histology varies with the phase of the lesion.  In younger patients, while the lesions are \u201cactive\u201d or growing, histology shows mitotic activity from plump proliferating endothelial cells that surround small irregular vascular spaces.  Mast cells may be increased within the lesion.  Classically, involution begins within the center of the mass, and the advances outward.  Fatty and fibrous tissue surround the vascular space; and, the fibro-fatty tissue eventually replaced the vascular stroma.  These features allow distinction from cavernous hemangiomas, that have larger vascular spaces that are lined by flattened endothelial cells.\n\n\n\u2022  Imaging\n\u00bb US\nUltrasound may play a dual role in capillary hemangioma \u2013 demonstrating the lesions as well as documenting their vascularity.  [Verity DH EYE 2006 - PMID: 17019424]  US shows great variability in lesion appearance, but can well document high-velocity flow in (100-1000 times normal) in feeding vessels.  [Verity2006]  Lesion involution is often preceded by stabilization in the rate of flow increase.  Although US can be used to follow the progression-regression sequence in these tumors, MR provides the best evaluation in the diagnostic phase. \n\n\u00bb CT\nThe appearance of orbital capillary hemangiomas varies over time.  Most commonly during the growing phase, they will appear as intensely enhancing lesions, that may be either well demarcated or poorly marginated.  Lesions may be more dense than brain (50-60 HU) due to the blood filled vascular spaces.  In the involution phase, the attenuation of the lesion will decrease, as fibro-fatty tissue replaces the vascularity.\n\n\u00bb MR\nThese lesions are usually well demarcated discrete lobulated masses with internal septations.  They are usually dark on T1W and become hyperintense with T2-weighting.  Bright contrast enhancement after Gadolinium is almost universal in these lesions.  As these lesions involute, fatty and fibrous tissue may replace the tumor and the lesion may show areas of T1 shortening.\n\n\u00bb Treatment and Prognosis\nThe majority of these lesions will undergo spontaneous regression as the child ages.  About one-half will show involution by age 5, and the overwhelming majority will show clear signs of involution by seven or eight years.  Lesions that present at younger ages may also regress earlier in the life of the child.  Both oral and parenteral steroids, interferon therapy, and surgery may be used when vision is threatened by periocular lesions.  Fractionated stereotactic radiation may have potential benefit in some cases that do not regress or are not amenable to surgery.  [Tsao MN J.

They consist of large sinusoidal vascular spaces which lack normal endothelial tight juctions.  As a result, bleeding is frequent.  The majority of bleeds from these lesions, however, are subclinical with nearly 100% demonstrating hemosiderin staining of the adjacent parenchyma at diagnosis.  There is a 0.5-1% incidence of symptomatic hemmorhage\/year.  The most common clinical presentation as a result of hemmorhage is the development of seizures or progressive neurologic deficits, with a seizure disorder being the presenting symptom in approximately 50% of patients with cavernous angiomas.  The degree to which a lesion is symptomatic is,like most CNS abnormalities, dependent on location. Brainstem lesions tend to present earlier with neurologic deficits.\n\nCavernous angiomas may occur anywhere within the CNS with roughly 3\/4 occurring supratentorially, 1\/4 within the posterior fossa and brainstem, and occasional lesions within the spinal cord.  While the occurrence may be sporadic, there is a strong familial association identified where close to 80% of members of affected families may demonstrate lesions.  In about 50% of patients the lesions will be multiple.  Whenever more than one cavernous malformation is identified in the CNS, there is probably an autosomal dominant inheritence.  This should prompt an evaluation of all first-degree relatives.\n\nImaging findings are related to the degree of prior hemmorhage of the lesions.  On CT, these lesions may be heavily calcified.  MR often demonstrates blood products of various ages centrally and a rim of hemosiderin peripherally.  Gradient-echo images may be helpful in identification of small lesions secondary to the gradient suseptibility or characteristic \"blooming\" artifact produced by hemosiderin.  Following contrast administration, on either CT or MR, variable enhancement may occur.","External Links":"rad.usuhs.mil\/rad\/home\/vascmalf\/malf0.html","Keywords":"cavernous angiomacavernoma","Reference":null,"Title":"Cavernous Malformation (Cavernous Angioma)"}}

Most patients with duplex collecting systems are asymptomatic (abnormalities are usually noted incidentally), but it is important to note that duplex systems are more likely to be associated with ureteropelvic obstruction, reflux, and infections. \n\nVarious imaging modalities may be useful in suggesting duplication, but CT is the superior modality for diagnosis.  Plain films will usually exhibit a duplex kidney which is longer than the nonduplex kidney (1-3 cm longer), but this is nonspecific.  Excretory urography may further characterize the renal anatomy and delineate anomalies, but may also prove difficult in discerning obstruction versus renal mass.  The use of ultrasound may show the presence of two collecting systems with intervening parenchyma, but does not rule out an intrarenal mass.  CT, however,  is useful in detecting obstruction and further characterizing the renal parenchyma.

The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related\u201d aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

Cholangiocarcinomas are encountered in 3 geographic regions: intrahepatic, extrahepatic (ie, perihilar), and distal extrahepatic. Perihilar tumors are the most common and intrahepatic tumors are the least common. Perihilar tumors also called Klatskin tumors occur at the bifurcation of right and left hepatic ducts. 95% of these tumors are ductal adenocarcinomas and the remainder are squamous cell tumors. Local extension occurs into the liver, porta hepatis, and regional lymph nodes of the celiac and pancreaticoduodenal chains. The etiology of most bile duct cancers remains undetermined. Long-standing inflammation, as with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) or chronic parasitic infection, has been suggested as playing a role by inducing hyperplasia, cellular proliferation, and, ultimately, malignant transformation. Cholangiocarcinomas is slow growing and tends to invade locally dissecting along tissue planes. In Southeast Asia, chronic infection with liver flukes, Clonorchis sinensis has been causally related to cholangiocarcinomas. It also has an association with ulcerative colitis and primary sclerosing cholangitis.  Increased incidence has been noted in exposure to Thortrast radiopaque medium and in rubber industries. Several congenital diseases also show a relationship, including choledochal cysts and Caroli\u2019s disease. \n\n\u2022  Clinical presentation:\nPatients often present with painless jaundice and many patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease.  Pruritis and non-specific abdominal pain are other common complaints. Physical exam findings include hepatomegaly (tender\/non-tender), a palpable non-tender gallbladder (Courvoisier sign) and splenomegaly secondary to portal hypertension. Lab findings include elevated LFT\u2019s.  CEA and CA 19-9 tumor markers may be positive but cholangiocarcinomas does not produce alpha feto proteins (AFP).\n\n\u2022 Imaging:\nInitial evaluation should be with ultrasound and CT.  The most common US finding is general ductal dilitation.  Focal ductal dilitation, lobar atrophy, bile duct wall thickening and rarely a polypoid mass within the ducts may also be seen.  CT demonstrates biliary dilation as well but can show thickening of the bile duct walls more accurately. In peripheral cholangiocarcinomas the CT scan is often nonspecific demonstrating minimal contrast enhancement with a poorly defined isoattenuating or hypoattenuating mass.  Delayed enhancement (8-10 min) is useful in hilar tumors.  The tumor itself is only identified in about 50% of cases.  CT is good at showing lymphadenopathy and lobar atrophy.  Cholangiography(ERCP or PTC) is very helpful in demonstrating ductal anatomy and has the added benefit of enabling stent placement for drainage. MRI Cholangiography is being used more frequently and may help define tumor extension into portal vessels.\n\n\u2022  Treatment:\nStenting is very useful in both palliative care to relieve obstruction and for symptomatic relief preop.  The only possible cure is complete resection but imaging confirmation of complete resection is often impossible. Lesions are considered unresectable if tumor involves either both lobes of the liver or major portal veins or hepatic arteries. Overall resecatability is about 40%. Chemo and radiation therapy can be used for palliative treatment but show little benefit. Celiac-plexus block via regional injection of alcohol or other sclerosing agent can relieve pain in the mid-back associated with retroperitoneal tumor growth.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"cholangiocarcinomaklatskindilated bile ducts","Reference":"Alimentary Tract Radiology 5th Edition, Vol 2.","Title":"Cholangiocarcinoma"}}

Lower lumbar disk herniation is a particularly common clinical problem. Herniation is a localized displacement of disk material through a defect or tear in the annulus fibrosis. The protruding or extruded material is typically comprised of nucleus pulposus but may also include annular tissue, fragmented bone, or cartilage. Disk herniations can cause localized pain arising from nerve endings in the annular fibers at the location of the herniation. Disk herniations also commonly cause radicular symptoms due to compression of spinal nerve roots exiting the neuroforamen at the level of the herniation or by compression of nerve roots traversing the spinal canal to exit at lower levels. Myelopathic symptoms occur if the herniated disk material compresses the spinal cord sufficiently to interfere with normal cord function.\n\nThe disk space is defined cranio-caudally by the vertebral body endplates and peripherally by the outer edges of the vertebral body ring apophyses (excluding osteophytes). In the axial plane, a \"localized\" disk herniation is limited to 25% or less of the disk circumference. \"Broad based\" refers to disk herniations between 25% to 50% of the disk circcumference. \"Concentric broad based disk bulge\" refers to a concentric bulge of the disk occupying greater than 50% of the disk circumference. Herniations may be described as \"protusions\" or \"extrusions.\" Protusion implies that the widest dimension of the protruded material is less than the width of the separation in the annular fibers at the neck of the protusion. Extrusion implies that the widest dimension of extruded material exceeds the width of the annular fiber tear at the neck of the protusion. A \"sequestered disk\" is a free fragment of extruded disk material which is no longer in continuity with the disk material within the disk space. A free fragment can migrate to any location and lodge above or below the disk space and in rare instances can transgress the dura and lie intradurally. \n\nThe diagnosis of disk herniation can be made by MR or CT. On MR the presence of disk material may be seen extending beyond the confines of the disk space. The disk material may be seen circumferentially bulging or focally protruding or extruding and compressing the thecal sac or nerve roots. This can be demonstrated in the axial or sagittal planes, and, if detected, should be confirmed in the other plane.  In general, the herniated disk material should have similar intensity or density to the parent disk. On MR, this is not always the case, depending on the state of hydration of the parent disk and the fragment and the particular pulse sequence used. [1]\n\nTreatment of disk herniation depends upon the level of the herniation, the severity of the herniation, and the nature of the symptoms it produces. Treatment ranges from very conservative therapies (e.g. bedrest, NSAIDs, analgesics, physical therapy) to minimally invasive therapies (e.g. steroid\/analgesic epidural injections) to fully invasive surgical procedures (e.g. laminectomy, discectomy, vertebral body fusions.) Surgical interventions are typically reserved for patients who have failed conservative treatment, who have intractable pain, or who have significant neurological symptoms resulting directly from the herniation.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"disk herniationdisk protrusiondisk extrusion","Reference":"Grossman R and Yousem D.

However, none of these modalities can assess the cord directly and its relationship to the surrounding structures.  The introduction of MR compatible hardware for spine stabilization and modification of life support devices for use in MR scanning has made imaging of the acutely injured spine possible.  Cord edema and hemorrhage are frequently seen in the acutely traumatized spinal cord.  Cord edema can cause focal enlargement of the cord, but more frequently elongates T1\/T2 due to the water content.  This is usually best seen on T2-weighted images as an area of increased signal.  Clinically, it may be important to distinguish an edematous cord from a hemorrhagic contusion (3).  Cord hemorrhages evolve similarly to intracerebral hemorrhage, and therefore acute hemorrhages tend to have low T1 and T2 signal characteristics.  On the T2-weighted sequences, the hemorrhagic low signal portion is often surrounded by a ring of high signal intensity edema.  Finally, cord maceration and transection represent the most severe form of cord injury.  This is usually seen as a loss of cord signal or marked inhomogenity of signal where the cord should be.  In this particular case, the thoracolumbar junction acts as a fulcrum, tending to produce flexion-compression (i.e., burst) fractures, with motion instability and a tendency to produce retropulsion of the fracture fragment.","External Links":"http:\/\/www.neurosurgery.org\/sections\/section.aspx?Section=PD&Page=ped_spine.asp","Keywords":"spine translationspinal cord injury","Reference":"http:\/\/www.neurosurgery.org\/sections\/section.aspx?Section=PD&Page=ped_spine.asp","Title":"Fracture dislocaton at thoraco-lumbar junction, resulting in spinal cord transection."}}

Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) was first described by Albright et al. in 1942.  It is a congenital hereditary abnormality that appears to be transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait characterized by hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, basal ganglion and soft tissue calcification.\n\nIn PHP, there is a defect in the parathyroid hormone receptor-adenylate cyclase system which accounts for end organ resistance.\n\nIn most patients with classic PHP, there is a deficiency of guanyl nucleotide regulatory protein (G-unit) that normally couples receptor activity to adenylate cyclase activity.  As a result, the kidney and, less commonly, the bones are unable to respond to parathyroid hormone.  There may also be renal inability to hydroxylase 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25 hydroxyvitamin D, the active form.\n\nPseudopseudohypoparathyroidism (PPHP) was the name selected by Albright and Reifenstein to describe a syndrome in short-statured patients with rounded faces, whose roentgen features simulated exactly those of PHP, the difference being the absence of blood chemical changes.\n\nOsteosclerosis, which may be generalized or localized, is the most common skeletal abnormality of hypoparathyroidism.  Typically, radiographic findings include increased radiodensity of the skeleton, calvarial thickening and hypoplastic dentition.  Subcutaneous calcification may be seen, especially in the area of the hips and shoulders.\n\nParticularly suggestive of hypoparathyroidism are intracranial calcifications of the basal ganglia that may later coalesce into homogeneous masses.  Occasionally, these calcifications develop in the cerebellum.\n\nThe clinical syndrome of pseudotumor cerebri in association with hypoparathyroidism was reported as early as 1959 by Palmer et al.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS:  Skeletal osteosclerosis is also seen in certain other disorders such as osteoblastic metastasis, myelofibrosis, Paget's disease, fluorosis, renal osteodystrophy, sickle cell anemia, and mastocytosis.  In these and other diseases, other radiographic findings are usually apparent, allowing accurate diagnosis.  In hypoparathyroidism and PHP, calvarial thickening and hypoplastic dentition are helpful clues, although Paget's disease, sickle cell anemia, and even metastasis may produce increased thickening and sclerosis of the calvarial vault.\n\nBasal ganglion calcification is particularly characteristic of hypoparathyroidism and PHP.  It is also seen without known cause in infectious disorders such as toxoplasmosis and cytomegalic inclusion disease, following radiation therapy, and following exposure to toxic substances such as carbon monoxide.\n\nSubcutaneous calcifications are also seen in collagen vascular disease, hypervitaminosis D, milk alkali syndrome, and renal osteodystrophy.  Hypoplastic dentition is also seen in cleidocranial dysostosis and pyknodysostosis, hypopituitarism, and hypothyroidism.\n\nSclerosis of the metaphyseal region of long bones seen in some patients with hypoparathyroidism is not specific.  It may be seen in children with systemic illness leading to growth arrest lines, leukemia during treatment, heavy metal poisoning, hypothyroidism, healing scurvy, and hypervitaminosis.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":null,"Title":"Hypoparathyroidism"}}

They are the most common cerebropontine angle (CPA) mass, making up approximately 80% of all CPA tumors and approximately 8% of all intracranial tumors in adults.\n\nPatients with vestibular schwannomas typically present between 30-50 years of age with the overall incidence of symptomatic vestibular schwannomas at 1\/100,000 person-years, though asymptomatic lesions may be more common.  Most lesions are unilateral.  However, as many as 10% of patients with vestibular schwannomas have Neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) with more than 75% of affected NF2 patients having bilateral vestibular schwannomas. \n\nMost patients present with complaints of hearing loss and\/or tinnitus.  Many also complain of difficulties with balance\/and or gait.  In a case series of 1000 acoustic Schwannomas, at time of diagnosis, 95% of patients had cochlear nerve symptoms, 61% had vestibular symptoms, 9% had trigeminal symptoms (most often sensory) and 6% had facial nerve complaints.  (Note that more patients had trigeminal symptoms than facial nerve symptoms, despite the close proximity of CN VII to CN VIII!)  \n\nAs most patients do have hearing loss from the affected nerve, audiometry is the most sensitive initial clinical screening test for a vestibular schwannoma.  However, HRCT or MRI (MRI with gadolinium contrast being preferable to HRCT) is needed for more definitive diagnosis.      \n   \nAcoustic schwannomas typically originate at the entrance of the internal auditory canal (IAC) and extend out into the CPA, resembling an \u201cice-cream cone,\u201d often causing mass affect on other structures as they enlarge.  This origin and appearance, evident with MRI and\/or HRCT, helps distinguish them from other CPA masses such as meningiomas (the 2nd most common CPA mass), epidermoid inclusion cysts (EIC\u2019s, 3d most common CPA mass), lipomas, angiomas, arachnoid cysts, mets, etc.  \n\nIn addition to the morphology and location\/origin of vestibular schwannomas, they also have enhancing characteristics that aid in distinguishing them from other CPA masses.  On T1-weighted images, schwannomas are hypointense compared to surrounding brain parenchyma, and enhance markedly with IV gadolinium.  T2-weighted images show hyperintense signal.  \n\nMeningiomas are typically isointense rather than hypointense on T1 but may be hyperintense with T2 imaging and also enhance brightly with gadolinium.  With the enhancement however, meningiomas are often more homogeneous in appearance than the more heterogeneous Schwannomas that is sometimes due to benign cystic degeneration.  Similar to Schwannomas, EIC\u2019s are hypointense with T1 images and are hyperintense with T2.  However, EIC\u2019s don\u2019t enhance with gadolinium (other than occasionally a thin ring of enhancement around their periphery).\n\nWhen observation is not appropriate, treatment of vestibular schwannomas is usually surgical, though radiation therapy (stereotactic or \"Gamma Knife\" is also being used with success.  Chemotherapy has not been proven beneficial.","External Links":"rad.usuhs.mil\/rad\/home\/postfoss\/postfossa2w.html","Keywords":"Acoustic SchwannomaVestibular SchwannomaCPA Mass","Reference":"Briggs, R; Gadre, A; Quinn, F; et. al.

Located  within  it  are meningeal layers, cranial nerves 5, 7, and 8, CSF and the flocculus of the cerebellum.  \n\nMeningiomas  arise  from the arachnoid granulation cells within the meningeal layers.  Other lesions in the  CPA,  from  which  they must  be  differentiated, include acoustic schwannoma, epidermoid, trigeminal schwannoma, exophytic brain stem glioma, metastasis, cholesteatoma (acquired), cholesterol granuloma, arachnoid  cyst,  aneurysm, and vertebrobasilar dolichoectasia.\n\nAcoustic  schwannomas are  the most common CPA masses and usually arise from the vestibular division of the 8th cranial nerve  within the  internal  auditory  canal.   They present as a mass within the internal auditory canal and often widen the canal.  Meningiomas, on the other hand, are extrinsic to the internal  auditory  canal  although  they  may compress the 7th-8th nerve complex (see Film 2). Classically, meningiomas are hyperdense compared to gray matter  on noncontrast CT and enhance intensely, whereas acoustic neuromas are isodense  or  hypodense  and  also enhance.  It may be difficult to visualize small acoustic neuromas or meningiomas on CT  because  of artifacts from the adjacent petrous temporal bone. When present, changes in the temporal bone can  be  quite  helpful. Acoustic neuroma will widen or erode the internal auditory canal in up  to  90%  of  cases, although small intracanalicular lesions are increasingly recognized with Gd-DTPA MR  prior  to  development  of internal auditory canal abnormalities.  Meningiomas may demonstrate hyperostosis  of  the  adjacent  temporal  bone.  MRI, without bone artifact, surpasses CT for mass localization relative  to  the  internal  auditory canal, especially with the use of Gd-DTPA.  Acoustic schwannomas are isointense to gray matter on T1-weighted images and enhance  homogeneously after Gd-DTPA.  Meningiomas are iso- to hypointense on T1-weighted images and  also  enhance  homogeneously,  but are located outside of the internal auditory canal.  On T2-weighted imaging, meningioma has a  variable signal  while  acoustic  schwannoma is usually increased in intensity. \n\nAngiographically, meningiomas classically have a persistent,  homogeneous blush lasting through the venous phase, which is not typical of  schwannoma or  the  other more common CPA lesions.  CPA masses, if large, enough, can be detected angiographically by characteristic displacement of the adjacent vascular  structures.    Such masses  may  elevate and posteriorly displace the anterior inferior cerebellar artery, elevate the superior cerebellar artery, displace the basilar artery if the mass extends  medially,  or  elevate  and compress the petrosal vein.  \n\nThe  other  lesions  within the differential diagnosis are less common.  Epidermoid tumors result from  epidermal  tissue  that  is included within the neural tube during embryonic development.  They may be markedly hypointense to cortex on T1-weighted MRI images (there are  some  reports  of hyperintense epidermoids on T1 imaging) and are hyperintense compared to CSF on T2 imaging with no  enhancement following  Gd - DTPA.   CT demonstrates a hypodense (density slightly greater than CSF) mass without  enhancement;  thus,  differentiation from  meningioma  is  not  difficult.  Trigeminal neuroma is radiographically  similar  to acoustic neuroma except the course follows that of the 5th cranial nerve and the IAC and 7th\/8th  nerve  complex  are  normal.  Exophytic brain stem glioma will have both intra- and extra-axial components by multiplanar  MR  imaging.    Arachnoid cysts  have  imaging  characteristics  paralleling  CSF.   Vascular abnormalities can usually be detected  by  MRI  demonstrating  flow void  and\/or  clot.   The flocculus of the cerebellum should not be mistaken for a lesion based on  its  known  anatomic  location  and signal  characteristics.    Metastatic  disease may be difficult to distinguish from benign lesions because of the  varied  appearance, unless  one sees multiple lesions or there is obvious bone destruction, which may require CT demonstration.  Acquired  cholesteatomas may  also require CT evaluation of the temporal bone to demonstrate the characteristic pattern of involvement of the middle  ear  which is   necessary   to  differentiate  these  lesions  from  the  bony destruction caused by metastatic disease.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":null,"Title":"Cerebellopontine angle meningioma"}}

This CT appearance was described by Kuhlman et al(1) in patients with invasive aspergillosis. In severely neutropenic patients, the CT halo sign is highly suggestive of infection by an angioinvasive fungus, most commonly Aspergillus. Vascular invasion by this fungus results in thrombosis of small- to medium-sized vessels, which causes ischemic necrosis. At pathologic examination, the nodules represent foci of infarction, and the halo of ground-glass attenuation results from alveolar hemorrhage. Although it is less common, the halo sign may also be observed in nonhemorrhagic nodules, in which case either tumor cells or inflammatory infiltrate account for the halo of ground-glass attenuation. Nonetheless, in the appropriate clinical setting, the halo sign is considered early evidence of pulmonary aspergillosis even before serologic tests become positive, and it warrants the administration of systemic antifungal therapy(2).\n\nEarly recognition of this complication is critical because this disease is associated with a high mortality rate that ranges from 50% to 90%.  The frequency of the halo sign in patients with invasive aspergillosis is relatively high in the early stages of the disease, but alters with time and becomes progressively less frequent. In a group of 25 patients with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis studied by using serial CT scans, the frequency of this sign ranged from 96% at day 0 to 19% at day 14(1).","External Links":null,"Keywords":"CTHaloSign","Reference":"1.\tKuhlman JE, Fishman EK, Siegelman SS.

They may be found in intracranial and intraspinal compartments.  In the head, meningiomas are most commonly located in frontal, parasagittal, and parietal convexities (50% of cases). Less than 10% of tumors are infratentorial; multiple meningiomas occur less than 10% of the time.  Clinical presentation is varied, depending on particular structures compressed by the mass. Headache and visual changes are frequently reported.  A large number of patients with meningiomas are asymptomatic.\n\nOrigins, Growth, and Histology\nThe majority of meningiomas are histologically benign tumors, arising from the cap cells of the arachnoid layer. In many cases, serial imaging studies have revealed a cessation of growth after the time of initial tumor detection. These tumors project inward from the dura, and can cause clinically significant effects due to compression of surrounding neurological structures.  A variety of classification systems based on cytology and histopathology are used with meningiomas.  While the overwhelming majority of meningiomas are histologically benign, the malignant type may result in rapid, widespread infiltration with small (microscopic) \"finger\" projections into adjacent cortex.  In patients with malignant meningiomas, marked deficits in physical and mental status may culminate in death.\n\nRadiological Findings\nPlain films may reveal hyperostosis, erosion, or calcification adjacent to tumor site.  Noncontrast CT's of meningiomas often reveal sharply demarcated, rounded, homogenous masses with slightly increased density when compared to surrounding cortex.  Up to 10% of meningiomas may appear isodense with respect to surrounding brain.  CT may reveal focal cerebral atrophy, edema, or widening of subarachnoid spaces, direct effects of tumor compression of surrounding structures.  Contrast enhanced CT most often reveals homogenous enhancement in approximately 85% of cases.\n\nOn MRI, T1 images are often hypo- or isointense; T2 images often reveal isointense or slightly hyperintense masses. Gadolinium increases signal intensity of meningiomas. A  \"dural tail\" consisting of tissue tapering into the dura may be appreciated.  Imaging studies may reveal extension of mass into cortical structures, or invasion of the calvarium. Angiography often reveals a homogenous, hypervascular pattern.\n\n\nTreatment Options\nA variety of clinical and experimental treatment options exist, including surgery, radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, brachytherapy, chemotherapy, and hormonal therapy.  Resection is the most widely utilized treatment option, although advanced age, concern about loss of neurological function due to surgery, advanced age, and being a poor surgical candidate preclude some from surgical options. Tumor embolization may be employed 3-5 days prior to surgery in an attempt to decrease blood supply to the meningioma. Recurrence of tumor is a possibility after resection. Complete removal of initial tumor and all affected bone results in recurrence rates of less than 10%.\n\nRadiotherapy is often employed during the presurgical period.  Likewise radiotherapy after incomplete resection of a meningioma may be of considerable benefit to patients. Stereotactic radiosurgery with a \"gamma knife\" has shown decrease in tumor size in approximately 50% of cases.  Since this technology is relatively new, long term outcome of gamma knife therapy is not known. Brachytherapy with iodine-125 has been described in the literature; long term outcomes have yet to be determined. Medical treatment options include recommendations of anticonvulsant prophylaxis in patients with supratentorial masses; corticosteroids to reduce brain swelling may also be warranted.  The use of traditional antineoplastic agents in treating meningiomas has not been met with great success.  Hormonal manipulation may have a beneficial effect on stopping tumor growth; research this area continues.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":"Akeyson et al.

These tumors may initially infiltrate the brain stem pathways without tissue destruction, and few deficits  may  be  present,  in spite  of  extensive  disease at the time of diagnosis.  Presenting complaints include cranial nerve deficits, disturbances of motor or sensory  pathways,  ataxia,  abnormal eye movements, somnolence, or hyperactivity.  Hydrocephalus is characteristically a late finding, with the exception of those tumors arising in  immediate  proximity to the aqueduct.  \n\nOn  CT,  these  tumors infiltrate and enlarge the brain stem and secondarily displace the fourth ventricle.  They commonly are hypodense but occasionally are of increased density compared to normal brain as seen on Film .3 in a different child.   Calcification  and cyst   formation  are  infrequent  (12%),  and  approximately  half demonstrate enhancement after contrast (Film .4).    When  present, enhancement  patterns  are variable, with diffuse, nodular, or ring enhancement seen.  A small number of these tumors  may  demonstrate exophytic  growth  into  the posterior fossa cisterns, particularly the cerebellopontine angle cistern.  These tumors tend  to  enhance with contrast administration.    \n\nBecause  of Hounsfield artifact in the posterior fossa, a small percentage of brain stem gliomas will be overlooked  on  initial  CT scans.

A positive correlation has been noted with breast carcinoma.  Peak incidence is in the fifth to seventh decades.  Most meningiomas arise from arachnoid caps cells in the arachnoid granulations.  A lesser number arise from dural fibroblasts.\n\nMeningiomas may be completely asymptomatic (>90%) or may present with hydrocephalus, seizures, focal neurological deficits, headaches, and neuropathies.  Symptoms usually depend on the location of the lesion.  90% are supratentorial. Common locations include the parasagital region, cerebral convexities and sphenoid ridge.  Others include the olfactory groove and the parasellar region.\n\nMeningiomas enhance uniformly on CT and are usually slightly hyperdense compared to surrounding brain on NCECT.  About one-quarter calcify.  With MRI, meningiomas are usually isointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, but can vary.  Homogeneous enhacement after gadolinium occurs as well.  Edema-like changes in the surrounding whate matter can occur and may persist for some time after removal of the mass.

Most (over 90%) are left-sided and associated congenital anomalies, such as congenital diaphragmatic hernias and congenital heart disease, are frequent.  The venous return is through the systemic circulation.  These may not only be seen adjacent to the mediastinum, but also in the mediastinum, pericardium, diaphragm, and retroperitoneum.  Rarely is a connection with the bronchial tree present and rarely are they symptomatic.  A majority of these are noticed incidentally.\n\nIntralobar sequestrations are located within the lung and have no separate pleural coverings.  Although their arterial supply is systemic, their venous return is through pulmonary veins.  Compared to the extralobar form, intralobar sequestrations are likely acquired lesions, possibly due to chronic bronchial obstruction or postobstructive pneumonia.  Connection to the bronchial tree may be present.  This variety may produce symptoms as a result of infections.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"pulmonary sequestration","Reference":"Hansell, D., et al.  Imaging of Diseases of the Chest, 4th Ed.

The nomenclature for the species of Pneumocystis that infects humans has been changed from Pneumocystis carinii to Pneumocystis jirovecii.

The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related\u201d aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

Approximately 10% of patients with acute appendicitis have a radiographically visible appendicolith.  One third of surgically removed appendices, however, contain an appendicolith.  The calcification may form around any type of nidus, including a piece of vegetable matter, swallowed foreign body, or even barium.  The appendicolith tends to be round or oval, smooth, and laminated (Film .2Z).  The size varies, but stones in the l-2 cm range are common with stones up to 4 cm in size having been reported.  The location is usually in the right lower quadrant, but the pelvis, right upper quadrant in the case of retrocecal appendix, and even the left upper quadrant may be the site.  \n\nThe differential diagnosis includes the following:\n\n\ta) Phlebolith - these rounded calcifications tend to occur in clusters, are usually lower in the pelvis, and frequently contain a central lucency.\n\tb) Calcified lymph node - these tend to be amorphous, irregular, \"popcorn\" calcifications.\n\tc) Ureteral calcifications - this calcification should conform to the course of the ureter and tends to be smaller and less often laminated.\n\td) Benign bone island in the iliac wing - this density will not move with changes in position of the patient, maintaining a constant location within the iliac bone.\n\nThe presence of an appendicolith is significant clinically since patients with this radiograph finding are more likely to have appendicitis complicated with perforation or abscess.  This is especially true in children.  \n\nThe plain film diagnosis of acute appendicitis in the absence of an appendicolith can be difficult with the plain film demonstrating abnormalities in approximately one half of patients.  The following radiographic findings have been described, but no one of these is as helpful as an appendicolith.  \n\n\t1) Abnormal bowel gas pattern.  The bowel gas pattern in acute appendicitis can be anywhere from normal to consistent with a complete small bowel obstruction.  A local ileus in the right lower quadrant with air fluid levels can be seen.  Occasionally fluid-filled right lower quadrant small bowel loops may present as a soft tissue mass.  A dilated transverse colon in pediatric patients with a perforated appendix has also been described.  \n\t2) Abnormal cecum and ascending colon.  Local inflammation and edema may cause thickening of the colon wall and widen the haustra.  A cecal air fluid level may be present.  \n\t3) Extraluminal soft tissue mass.  This finding can be seen in up to one third of patients with perforation.  A combination of edema, fluid, and fluid-filled loops of small bowel produce the effect.  A mottled gas collection within the soft tissue mass is highly suggestive of an abscess.  \n\t4) Obliteration of normal fat planes.  Sufficient inflammation from appendicitis may alter the water density of the surrounding fat and obscure the right properitoneal flank stripe, psoas muscle, or obturator muscle.  \n\t5) A small amount of free intraperitoneal or retroperitoneal air may rarely be present.\n\nThe use of the barium enema, ultrasound, and CT in diagnosing acute appendicitis will be discussed in a separate section.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":null,"Title":"Acute appendicitis with an appendicolith"}}

Common etiologies include diverticulosis, angiodysplasia, neoplasm, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) [1].  The most common etiology in patients over 50 is diverticulosis, while the most common etiology in young patients is IBD [1].  Infection is the most common etiology in immunocompromised hosts [1].\n\n     Acute lower gastrointestinal (GI) hemorrhage is a potentially life threatening condition.  Although most cases can be managed medically, 10-15% require intervention to control the hemorrhage [2].  Therapeutic options include surgery, vasopressin infusion, endoscopy, and transcatheter embolization.  Surgery is associated with mortality rates as high as 15-30% in emergent operations, and vasopressin is associated with high rates of rebleeding and systemic side effects [2].  Although colonoscopy has become first line in the investigation and treatment of lower GI hemorrhage, endoscopy is limited in cases of massive hemorrhage because the presence of copious amounts of blood and stool in the bowel may prevent visualization of a bleeding source [2].  Given a positive dynamic bleeding scan, mesenteric angiography becomes important not only because it localizes active bleeding, but also because it provides a pathway for potential treatment [2].  Modern transcatheter embolotherapy has become an option in the the management of lower GI hemorrhage, and microcoils are the preferred embolic agent for many interventionalists [2].\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________\nTable 1.

Numbers in parentheses are percentages.  Asterisks indicate studies in which microcoils were the only agents of embolization.  It is interesting to note that studies from the 1980s (not charted) demonstrate a 20% incidence of clinically significant postembolization infarction, whereas these later studies demonstrate no or few cases of postembolization infarction [2].  It is reasonable to suspect that this difference is a result of the advent of finer coaxial systems and microcoils, which have enabled more distal and selective catheterization and embolization.\n\n     Embolization may not be possible in all patients in whom bleeding is identified at angiographic examination because of several factors.  These factors include vessel spasm, spontaneous cessation of bleeding, and vessel tortuosity [7].  Technical failure caused by these factors occurs in approximately 20% of cases at Naval Medical Center San Diego, which is similar to rates reported in the literature [2],[7].","External Links":null,"Keywords":"microcoilembolizationgastrointestinal bleed","Reference":"1.

Fluctuations or worsening symptoms and sudden improvements are common during the first 24 to 48 hours, probably because of emboli passing distally. Usually embolic infarcts are large, and deficits are more severe in patients with emboli than with in situ occlusions. Single or infrequent but longer lasting TIAs may precede embolic infarctions. Embolic events often occur during activity or sudden straining, coughing, or sneezing. Infarcts may involve multiple vascular territories and are mixed in age. Early angiographic or TCD studies may show the presence of distal intra-arterial emboli. Hemorrhagic conversion of infarcted areas is commonly noted on CT and MRI scans. Infarcts are often wedge-shaped and involve the cerebral cortical surface.(1)\n\nAtrial fibrillation is the underlying cause of 30,000 to 40,000 embolic strokes per year in the United States. The precentage of AF caused strokes increases with age, rising from 1.5 percent in patients aged 50 to 59 years to 23.5 percent in patients aged 80 to 89 years. Although co-morbid conditions such as hypertension and vascular disease are factors, the predominant cause of strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation is embolization of a clot from the left atrium.\n\nWhen evaluated using transesophageal echocardiography, up to 30 percent of patients with atrial fibrillation and embolic stroke are found to have atrial thrombi within 72 hours of the stroke. Risk factors for stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation include a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke, age greater than 65 years, a history of hypertension, the presence of a prosthetic heart valve (mechanical or tissue), rheumatic heart disease, left ventricular systolic dysfunction, or diabetes.(2)","External Links":null,"Keywords":"cerebral infarction ischemiaEmbolismatrial fibrillation","Reference":"1.

However, it may also cause intestinal obstruction as a lead point for a volvulus or commonly mimics appendicitis.  In 80-85% of cases, a Meckel Diverticulum is ectopic gastric mucosa.  It can also be ectopic pancreatic, duodenal, or colonic tissue.  The pancreatic tissue secretes digestive enzymes, which can cause an ulcer in the small bowel distal to the Meckel Diverticulum.

They account for 15-20% of all primary brain tumors. They are most commonly found in the parasagittal dura, convexities, sphenoid wing, cerebellopontine angle cistern, and olfactory groove.  Up to 90% are supratentorial, and 1% occur outside the CNS (presumably due to arachnoid rests).  Less than 10% cause symptoms, with the majority discovered incidentally or at autopsy or on brain imaging.\n\nOn CT, they are typically hyperdense, with up to 20% demonstrating calcification.  On MR, they are typically well-circumscribed and iso- to hypointense on T1, iso- to hyperintense on T2, and strongly enhancing.  A dural tail is seen in up to 72%, which is thought to represent a neoplastic infiltration or a reactive fibrovascular proliferation of the meninges.  This finding is suggestive but not specific, however.  Similarly, a distinct cleft of arachnoid with trapped CSF and vessels is common.  Meningiomas typically take one of two forms, either \u201cglobose\u201d (spherical) or \u201cen plaque\u201d (flat).\n\nMeningiomas may encase and narrow vessels, and incite a varying amount of edema, depending on location (cerebral cortical lesions have more edema, basal cisterns \u2013 less).

On angiography, the \u201cin-law\u201d sign has been described (coming early and staying late) with an early blush and delayed washout.  Due to their vascularity, preoperative embolization can be performed (particularly at the skull base, where the lesions may be unresectable).\n\nMalignant meningiomas, a rare variant, demonstrate rapid growth or intraparenchymal invasion.

Although the typical clinical presentation is a young adult with a painless rapidly growing extremity mass (80-95%of patients), there is a wide age variation with most common age group being the 15-35 year age group. Besides the extremities, primary synovial sarcomas have been described throughout the body to include the heart, brain, and abdomen.\n\nSarcomas are classified according to the tissue they most closely resemble, as such, synovial sarcoma is classically described as a having a biphasic fibrous spindle cell population admixed with an epitheliod component. They likely originate from genetic mutations in totipotent mesenchymal cells, which may explain variations in histologic and anatomic presentation as well as the clinical course of the neoplasm. The translocation t(X:18) is present in greater than 90% of synovial sarcomas.\n\nRadiographs of these patients may be nomral in one-half of patients. Thirty percent of masses shows calcification or less commonly ossification.  In 11-20% of patients, bony erosion of the adjacent bone can be seen.  Both CT and MRI can show areas of necrotic or hemoorhage that appear as aresa of low attenuation on CT images and high attenuation on T2-weighted MR images. Both modalities can demonstrate a multilobulated lesion with septation. Fluid-fluid levels may be seen in areas of hemorrhage. For staging of tumors, MRI is the best modality.  The histologic and chromosomal findings described above are often the key to diagnosis.\n\nTreatment for all synovial sarcomas is resection. According to a retrospective study performed by Ferrari et al, primary synovial sarcoma with clear margins and no evidence of metastases carries a 5-year overall survival of greater than 70%(1). That rate decreases to less than 40% with locally advanced disease. Unfortunately, nearly 60% of those with macroscopically resected disease developed metastases within 5 years (primarily to the lungs and liver). Nearly 40% of patients also receiving chemotherapy (doxyrubicin, cyclophosphamide, and occasionally cisplatin) developed metastases within 5 years (1).","External Links":null,"Keywords":"synovial sarcoma","Reference":"1.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a fungus usually acquired via inhalation of dehydrated yeast cells or basidiospores that has been shown in analysis of soils to be found with pigeon excreta. Inhalation of the spores is believed to be the primary means of acquisition.  When considering the prevalence of the disease, serologic studies have demonstrated evidence of widespread subclinical infection in individuals without a history of symptomatic infection with most adults having a positive serum antibody to Cryptococcus neoformans. Thus, it appears that the subclinical primary infection is common and the vast majority of patients are asymptomatic.  Despite strong serologic evidence, symptomatic Cryptococcus remains a very rare disease in individuals without impaired immunity.  An active surveillance conducted in the early 90\u2019s in Alabama estimated the incidence of active Cryptococcus infections at 0.84 cases per 100,000 in non-HIV individuals.  However, in patients with advanced HIV infections living in San Francisco and Atlanta in the early 90\u2019s, the incidence was higher and was estimated to be anywhere from 17 to 66 cases per 1000 individuals.  Other patients who appear to be at increased risk include cancer patients and those individuals receiving organ transplants.  Thus, the subsequent course of the infection (resolution vs. latent infection vs. acute infection with or without dissemination) appears to be primarily determined by the host\u2019s immune status.","Exam":"On examination the patient\u2019s lungs were clear to auscultation.

AVFs of the lower extremity can be divided into congenital and acquired causes.  Iatrogenic causes, primarily occurring during cardiac catheterization, are the most common etiology.  These may ensue when a needle tract crosses both femoral the artery and vein, and is then dilated during catheterization, creating a communication between the vessels after catheter removal.  In three large series from experienced cardiac catheterization centers, the incidence of AVF was 0.1-0.2%. Similar values have been noted with the use of arterial closure devices. Other femoral arterial complications include pseudoaneurysm formation, hematoma, groin hemorrhage that may require transfusion, and arterial occlusion.  Risk factors for AVF formation during catheterization include low femoral arterial puncture, large arterial sheath size, older age, and prolonged anticoagulation or fibrinolytic therapy. The incidence is higher in therapeutic compared to diagnostic catheterization (0.9 versus 0.2% in one report).\n\nAlmost all AVFs are clinically silent early in the postcatheterization period. If untreated, the time of onset of clinical presentation ranges from two days to several months after catheterization.  Clinical complications include lower extremity edema, varicose veins, nerve compression, the development of or worsening of intermittent claudication, and rest pain secondary to distal ischemia. The most significant complication is the development of high-output heart failure which, in an older report, was estimated to occur after 0.01 to 0.02 percent of cardiac catheterizations.\n\nEarly diagnosis is dependent upon careful examination of the groin area, with evaluation for a femoral bruit, large hematoma, decreased or absent lower extremity pulses, or a groin pulsatile mass. Any of these findings is suggestive of a vascular complication and needs to be investigated further.  Prior to the development and widespread use of ultrasound-Doppler technology, AVFs were suspected on clinical findings and diagnosed with an arteriogram. However, Doppler ultrasound is the current diagnostic test of choice in evaluating patients with suspected AVFs. The ultrasound image appears as a blush in the extremity and the connecting artery and vein can often be identified.\n\nBecause of greater awareness and ease of diagnosis, AVFs come to attention and, if necessary, are treated early. On the other hand, small AVFs are often monitored with ultrasound imaging. Indications for intervention are lack of spontaneous closure, increase in fistula size, and\/or the development of symptoms.  Surgical repair is the most common approach for fistulas that need closure, but other modalities have been evaluated. These nonsurgical alternatives may be particularly important in patients treated with aggressive antiplatelet therapy. One method is ultrasound-guided compression repair or closure (UGCR). This technique involves placing the ultrasound probe on the skin over the AVF and then compressing the area (usually for ten minute periods) with a sufficient force to abolish flow through the fistula without sacrificing distal perfusion of the leg. Compression results in stasis of blood in the fistula and secondary thrombosis.  UGCR has been used successfully in pseudoaneurysms after cardiac catheterization, but only limited data are available for AVFs with variable success.\n\nPreliminary data suggest that percutaneous approaches also may prove to have a role. One report evaluated 53 patients, 21 with an AV fistula and most of the remainder with a pseudoaneurysm, who failed repeated attempts at UGCR. The patients were primarily treated with either implantation of a covered stent or coil embolization. The procedure was successful in 47 (89 percent). Follow-up documented closure of all lesions, but four late stent occlusions occurred at three to six months.  This study and other early investigations are suggestive that percutaneous interventions such as stent placement or embolization may be effective measures to avoid surgical repair when UGCR fails to result in obliteration of the AVF.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"AVFcatherizationiatrogenic","Reference":"Kesseler J, Mohler ER.

Acute focal pyelonephritis","Discussion":"Renal cell carcinoma, the most common primary tumor of the kidney, is found incidentally in many patients with the widespread use of cross-sectional imaging.  In fact, as many as one-half of renal cell carcinomas are discovered incidentally at early stages when they are asymptomatic.  CT has also played an essential role in staging renal cell carcinoma in order to guide prognosis and surgical planning.  The patient in this case underwent partial nephrectomy for his renal cell carcinoma.  As a result, this case generates several interesting questions.  What is the standard protocol for staging renal cell carcinoma with CT?  What staging systems exist for renal cell carcinoma and what are their differences?  Finally, what factors determine the use of radical nephrectomy versus nephron-sparing surgical techniques?\n\t\nOnce a renal cell carcinoma is suspected incidentally, there is a standard protocol for work-up using CT.  First, an unenhanced CT is preformed to use as a baseline once intravenous contrast material is administered.  Due to a significant vascular supply, renal cell carcinomas enhance following administration of contrast.  12 HU of enhancement suggest possible malignancy.  Following the administration of contrast, images are obtained during the corticomedullary phase, nephrographic phase, and excretory phase.  \n      \nThe corticomedullary phase occurs between 25 and 70 seconds after injection and primarily enhances the renal cortex.  While not perfect for detecting small lesions, this phase can aid in diagnosing venous extension of the tumor.  The nephrographic phase, which occurs between 80 and 180 seconds following injection, is best for detecting renal masses and analyzing indeterminate lesions.  Finally, the excretory phase begins 180 seconds following injection and helps evaluate the collecting system, as well as the calices and renal pelvis.  \n     \n Renal cell carcinoma has two potential staging systems: the Robson classification and the TMN classification.  CT is reported to be 91% accurate in staging renal cell carcinoma.  The TMN classification is considered more precise because of its clear definition of the anatomic extent of the tumor.  With respect to the TMN classification, T1 is reserved for tumors less than 7 cm and T2 for tumors greater than 7 cm.  T3 is broken down into three groups based on tumor position.  T3a indicates spread to the perinephric fat.  T3b indicates that the tumor is present in the renal vein only.  T3c describes a tumor in the infradiaphragmatic IVC.  T4a and T4b describe tumors with direct invasion of adjacent organs and presence in the supradiaphragmatic IVC, respectively.  N1-3 are reserved for regional lymph node metastases and M1a-d for distant metastases.  \n    \nThe Robson classification is staged I-IV.  I is given to a tumor confined within the renal capsule.  II indicates spread to the perinephric fat.  IIIA describes the presence of a venous thrombus, whereas IIIB describes regional lymph node metastases.  IVA indicates direct invasion of adjacent organs and IVB indicates distant metastases.  An important downfall of the Robson classification is that it uses stage III to describe both patients with venous extension alone and patients with regional lymph node metastases.  The treatment for these two groups of patients varies significantly.  Venous extension of the tumor can be treated surgically, whereas lymph node metastases indicate a need for palliative therapy.  \n     \nDue to the rapid increase in incidental discovery of renal cell carcinoma, many tumors are small in size and early-stage.  Therefore, nephron-sparing surgery is often an option.  The procedure consists of excision of the renal tumor and obtaining 0.5 cm margins of normal renal tissue and preserving the largest amount of functioning renal parenchyma.  This procedure is particularly desirable when radical nephrectomy would lead to dialysis.  Therefore, it is indicated in patients with a solitary functioning kidney, compromised renal function, or bilateral tumors.  In addition, data indicates that small <4 cm in diameter lesions, which are polar, cortical, and a safe distance away from the renal hilum and collecting systems, have similar survival rates for the nephron-sparing procedure and radical nephrectomy.  The size and position of the patient\u2019s tumor in this case made him a good candidate for the nephron-sparing procedure.","Exam":"No significant physical exam and laboratory findings.","Findings":"Exophytic mass off inferior pole of left kidney.

CT is the most valuable imaging modality.  It can confirm the nature of the mass and stage the tumor by providing visualization of the lymph nodes, renal vein, and hepatic involvement.

Radical nephrectomy is common for a localized renal cell carcinoma.  The indications for partial nephrectomy are reviewed in the discussion.  Radiofrequency and cryosurgical ablation are new techniques being studied.  Chemotherapy is not effective in treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.  Cryoreductive nephrectomy is recommended for patients who are in good status and have metastatic primary disease.  Disease-free five-year survival is 90-100 percent for patients with tumors confined by the renal capsule.  Tumors extending beyond the capsule have a 50-60 percent rate of disease-free five-year survival.  The five-year disease-free survival drops to 0-15 percent for node-positive tumors.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Renal cell carcinomapartial nephrectomy","Reference":"Rugo Hope S, \"Oncology\" (Chapter).

Structurally MIBG resembles norepinephrine and guanethidine (neurosecretory-depleting agent).  MIBG is taken up into the storage granules of both normal and abnormal neural crest cells.  The uptake is proportional to the number of neurosecretory granules within a tumor.  MIBG uptake is blocked by many drugs.  Catecholamine agonists (phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine), antipsychotics (phenothiazines), tricyclic antidepressants, calcium channel blockers, long acting beta blockers (labetalol), drugs that deplete catocholamine stores (reserpine, guanethidine) and cocaine are examples of drugs that interfere with MIBG uptake.  Radiolabeling is done with I-123 and I-131  (I-123:  half life 13.2 hrs, energy 159 KeV; I-131: half life 8.1 days, energy 364 KeV).  \nI-123 MIBG is used in much larger administration activities because of its much lower absorbed radiation dose per mCi compared with I-131.  In addition, current  gamma camera detection crystals can more efficiently detect the 159 KeV photons.  Collimation is easier at lower energy and I-123 has a higher photon flux at 24 hour imaging.  For these reasons MIBG studies with \n\nI-123 is of considerably higher quality than with I-131.  Normal distribution of  MIBG includes salivary glands, myocardium, liver and urine.  Amount in the GI tract is variable and related to excretion into the gut.  A small percentage of patients show some activity in a blocked thyroid gland, normal adrenals, lung, and skeletal muscle.  In normal subjects, activity should not be seen in bone, bone marrow or spleen.  Utilizing SPECT MIBG can increase certainty of interpretation over planar imaging although it has not shown to increase the number of lesions detected.\nAlthough in this particuar case, the tumor was not identified on planar images but it was visualized on SPECT imaging.   Overall, primary tumor, lymph node metastasis, bone and bone marrow metastasis are detected using MIBG.\n\nPheochromocytoma is a rare tumor of chromaffin cells most commonly arising from the adrenal medulla. An estimated 800 cases are diagnosed yearly in the U.S. The peak incidence is in the third to fifth decades of life. Bilateral disease is present in approximately 10% of patients. Bilaterality is much more common in familial pheochromocytoma, often found in association with the familial multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (MEN, types IIA and IIB). In patients with MEN type II syndromes, the risk of developing a contralateral tumor following unilateral adrenalectomy is approximately 50%. Other syndromes associated with pheochromocytoma include neurofibromatosis, von Hippel-Lindau disease, cerebellar hemangioblastoma, Sturge-Weber\\'s syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis. Therefore, all patients with pheochromocytomas should be screened for MEN-2 and von Hippel-Lindau disease to avert further morbidity and mortality in the patients and their families. Extra-adrenal pheochromocytoma or functional paraganglioma occurs in approximately 10% to 15% of cases and may arise from any extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue in the body associated with sympathetic ganglia. \n\nExtra-adrenal pheochromocytoma is most often located within the abdomen and may have greater malignant potential than adrenal pheochromocytoma.  Extra-adrenal tumors usually have a poorer prognosis than adrenal tumors.  Due to the production and release of catecholamines, pheochromocytomas cause hypertension. However, only 0.1% to 0.5% of all hypertension patients will be found to have a pheochromocytoma. The importance of the recognition of this disease is that over 90% of patients properly diagnosed and treated are curable.\n\nThe hypertension caused by pheochromocytoma may be sustained or paroxysmal and is often severe with occasional malignant features of encephalopathy, retinopathy and proteinuria. Less commonly, severe hypertensive reactions may occur during incidental surgery, following trauma, exercise, or micturition (in the setting of bladder pheochromocytoma) when the diagnosis is unsuspected. Other clinical features of pheochromocytoma include headache, sweating, palpitation, tachycardia and severe anxiety along with epigastric or chest pain. The diagnosis of pheochromocytoma is established by the demonstration of elevated 24-hour urinary excretion of free catecholamines (norepinephrine and epinephrine) or catecholamine metabolites (VMA and total metanephrines). The measurement of plasma catecholamines can also be of value in the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. However, the measurement of plasma catecholamines has limited sensitivity and specificity. Plasma metanephrines have been reported to be more sensitive than plasma catecholamines. \n\nOnce the diagnosis is confirmed by biochemical determinations the localization and extent of disease should be determined. Ninety-seven percent are found in the abdomen, 2% to 3% in the thorax, and 1% in the neck. The initial studies should be a chest film and abdominal computed tomographic (CT) scan. \n\nI123meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) has been found to be useful as a scintigraphic localization agent. If the tumor is not adequately localized by these methods then magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or rarely, vena cava catheterization with selective venous sampling for catecholamines may be indicated. CT and MRI scans are about equally sensitive (98%-100%), while MIBG scanning has a sensitivity of only 80%. However, MIBG scanning has a specificity of 100%, compared to specificity of 70% for CT and MRI.  Surgical resection is the standard curative modality. If the primary tumor is localized to the adrenal gland and is benign, then survival is that of the normal age-matched population.

The majority (>90%) of pheochromocytomas are found in the adrenal glands. A 10% rule for pheochromocytomas says that 10% are malignant, 10% are bilateral and 10% are extra-adrenal. They occur with equal frequency in males and females and can occur at any age. The classic symptoms include episodes of headaches, palpitations, diaphoresis and severe hypertension.  24 hour urine tests for catecholamines, metanephrines and VMA are helpful for diagnosis. A new plasma free metanephrines assay has higher sensitivity of 99% compared to 63% for VMA and 83% to 85% for urinary or plasma catecholamines. \n   \n    Extra-adrenal pheochromocytomas can occur anywhere that sympathetic nervous tissue exists. Two common locations are the organ of Zuckerkandl and the bladder wall. CT and MRI have high sensitivity for detection of pheochromocytomas. CT is faster, less expensive and generally more available than MRI, but is less specific for distinguishing adrenal pheochromocytoma from other masses.  MRI is more specific for pheochromocytoma, but not as well tolerated as CT.  A nuclear medicine scan with I-131 meta-iodobenzylguanidine is more specific and is particularly useful in cases where pheochromocytoma is stronly suspected clinically but not visualized anatomically by CT or MRI as it can screen the entire body for a focus of uptake. The false-negative rate of MIBG scintigraphy is 10%. \nCT typically demonstrates a large adrenal mass without calcification on the non-contrast CT.  If contrast is given the tumor may have heterogenous enhancement.  Contrast is not essential for detection and usually is not given if pheochromocytoma is suspected due to reported cases in which iodinated contrast caused precipitation of hypertensive crisis.   CT is reported to be more than 93% sensitive and 95 % specific for the diagnosis of pheochromocytomas.  \n   \n   The differential diagnosis for large necrotic adrenal masses include adrenal cortical carcinomas and metastases, but in the context of confirmatory laboratory values the diagnosis can be made with near 100% accuracy.\n   \n   \n   RadioGraphics 2004;24:S87-S99\n    \n   >>Pheochromocytomas are often clinically silent, and the diagnosis can sometimes be first made at imaging. Although an incidental adrenal nodule is unlikely to represent a pheochromocytoma, additional endocrine investigation is warranted if there is any clinical suspicion for this tumor. As with every imaging interpretation, radiologists should be cognizant of the individual patient\u2019s clinical history and, in particular, of his or her blood pressure status. Despite the fact that most pheochromocytomas have high signal intensity on T2-weighted MR images, more than 30% have low signal intensity on these images. Although pheochromocytomas usually show increased uptake on FDG PET scans, results at conventional radionuclide imaging can also be inconsistent. However, new PET radioisotopes may allow more consistently accurate tests in the future, and these tests may soon play a larger role in the imaging evaluation of both incidental adrenal masses and suspected pheochromocytomas. Pheochromocytoma currently remains a true imaging chameleon, and its diagnosis should always be considered in the imaging evaluation of a patient with an adrenal mass, hypertension, or characteristic symptoms.\n\n    Most pheochromocytomas have an attenuation higher than 10 HU; rarely do they contain sufficient intracellular fat to have an attenuation of less than 10 HU. Still, some pheochromocytomas could be incorrectly categorized as adenomas. Pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas with macroscopic fat may also be seen. Conversely, some pheochromocytomas may demonstrate very high attenuation due to hemorrhage. << RadioGraphics 2004;24:S87-S99","External Links":"www.emedicine.com\/radio\/topic552.htm","Keywords":"pheochromocytomaAdrenal","Reference":".http:\/\/www.pheochromocytoma.org\n\n.Pheochromocytoma  January 14, 2002   Author: Ann T Sweeney, MD\nhttp:\/\/www.emedicine.com\/med\/topic1816.htm\n\n.Pheochromocytoma  May 3, 2002 Anant Krishnan, MD\nhttp:\/\/www.emedicine.com\/radio\/topic552.htm\n\n.Pheochromocytoma: An Imaging Chameleon\n RadioGraphics 2004;24:S87-S99","Title":"Pheochromocytoma"}}

The incidence of hip fractures is rising in parallel with the rising age of our population, leading to increased disability and medical cost. Advancing age is the greatest risk factor for hip fractures; other risk factors include being Caucasian and female, having a maternal history of hip fracture, having decreased bone density, visual impairment or dementia, a sedentary lifestyle, smoking, a history of glucocorticoid, benzodiazepine or anticonvulsant use, or a history of hyperthyroidism. \n\nHip fractures often have a significant impact on the life of the person affected. Between 15-20% of elderly patients with a hip fracture die within one year of the injury. Half of the patients with a hip fractures who had previously lived independently are unable to do so following the fracture. In addition to the significant mortality, patients with hip fractures and their surgical correction are at risk for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, delirium, and global deterioration of functionality. \n\nPatients with hip fractures often have a history of a fall followed by pain in the hip, groin, buttocks or back. They may have difficulty walking or bearing weight after the fall. On physical exam, there may be shortening and external rotation of the affected lower extremity. A history of trauma is not necessary, however, and patients with risk factors who present with hip pain or difficulty bearing weight should be evaluated thoroughly for an occult hip fracture and for osteoporosis that is often found in the elderly age group.\n\nTo evaluate for possible femoral fractures, radiographs should be done first. However, in patients with negative radiographs but a high clinical suspicion for fracture, MR imaging is the best imaging test to diagnose a fracture missed on plain radiographs. Early diagnosis is important in order that the hip fractures can be surgically corrected, preferably within 2-3 days of injury in order to reduce hospitalization and morbidity. \n\nIngari et al showed that low-signal-intensity on T1-weighted MR images were correlative with non-displaced fractures induced in cadavers. In contrast, the high-signal-intensity that is seen on the T2-weighted MR image may represent the fracture and secondary post-traumatic edema and inflammation and may appear more extensive than the actual fracture. MR should therefore be acquired without delay if plain radiographs are negative but clinical suspicion remains high.\n\nIf MR imaging is not available, bone scans of the hip can be useful for identifying proximal femoral fractures. However, bone scans demonstrate fracture because of the increased metabolic activity surrounding the injury; in the elderly, the bone scans may not be positive until 3 days after injury. This delay can have a negative impact on the patient\u2019s ultimate recovery. Therefore if MR imaging is available, it is the imaging test of choice in the patient with suspected hip fracture but with negative radiographs.\n\nHip fractures in the elderly have a significant rate of morbidity and mortality. Fractures of the femoral neck can lead to avascular necrosis of the femoral head due to disrupted blood supply from the lateral circumflex femoral artery. Fractures can also lead to malunion or nonunion between fragments as well as degenerative changes in the hip joint. Also, as mentioned previously, people who suffer a hip fracture are at significant risk for developing deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, pressure sores, delirium, infections, and decreased conditioning and functionality. Extended periods of hospitalization and limited mobility combine to create a major obstacle to the elderly person who may never be able to recover fully.\n\nPreventive measures are important in preventing hip fractures in the elderly. The USPSTF recommends routine bone mineral density screening for women after age 65 years, and after age 60 years in high risk women. Treatment of those with decreased bone density with bisphosphonates has been shown to reduce fracture risk. High-dose oral vitamin D supplementation has also been shown to reduce the risk of fractures. Modifiable lifestyle factors include smoking cessation and weight-bearing exercise. \n\nIn patients with hip fractures, early diagnosis and surgical fixation have been shown to reduce hospitalization and adverse events. Aggressive physical therapy is also very important in returning a patient to a functional level as close to baseline as possible. Plain radiographs are the first diagnostic imaging study for evaluating for hip fracture. However, if these are negative but clinical suspicion remains high for a fracture, MR imaging should be done for definitive diagnosis. \n\nReferences:\n\nBeaupre L, Jones A, Saunders D, Johnston W, Buckingham J, Majumdar S.

Now typically noted around the age of 4-5 years old.  If they go undetected other symptoms are determined by the middle ear structure they interfere with.  Facial nerve paralysis, conductive or sensorineural hearing loss, vertigo and extension into the middle fossa are all possibilities.  The most common complication is a conductive hearing loss due to fixation of the ossicles by the mass.  However, some large cholesteatomas can allow for sound conduction through the cholesteatoma itself.\n\nLocation: Most commonly found in the anterior superior quadrant of the tympanic membrane when found early, but as they grow they tend to migrate to the posterior hypotympanum.\n\nPathophysiology: There are four theories on how a congenital cholesteatoma is formed, the most widely accepted is the epithelial rest theory\n- Epithelial rests: Teed-Michael theory, ectodermal implants have been found in the 10 week old fetus between the first branchial cleft and pouch which is distinct from the surrounding tissue.  They have an unknown function and typically are resorbed at 33 weeks gestion.  If they do not involute then they may form a chronic cholesteatoma.  While there is histologic evidence of rests prior to 33 weeks there are now two documented histological cases such rests persisting after 33 weeks.\n- Invagination: This theory suggested that tissue from the external canal invaginates through the tympanic membrane due to a very small inflammatory injury near the neck of the malleus which causes adherence of squamous tissue to the malleus.  This may occur in utero or during childhood.   Another related theory is that there is no actual macroscopic perforation of the tympanic membrane, only microperforations of the basal layer.  This allows for squamous epithelium to enter the middle ear space.\n- Implantation: This is actually a theory against the existence of congenital cholesteatomas and implies that they are actually formed by unrecognized perforations of the tympanic membrane.\n- Metaplasia: This theory explains that epithelial tissue in the middle ear is via metaplasia to keratinizing squamous epithelium, although this theory appears to be unlikely due to the fact that most congenital cholesteatomas occur in one quadrant of the middle ear.\nHistology: Stratified squamous epithelial lined cyst which is filled with keratinous debris, this histology of a congential cholesteatoma is exactly the same as an acquired cholesteatoma.\nRadiology: High resolution CT of the temporal bone is the ideal modality for imaging congenital cholesteatomas, especially since most patients are young and without other ear pathology found in patients with aquired cholesteatomas.  On CT a cholesteatoma appears as a hypodense lesion with well defined margins which does not enhance with constrast.\nMR imaging of the temporal bone may also be used.  This will show low signal on T1W with moderately high signal on T2W images.  It does not enhance with gadolinium.  MR imaging is useful for differentiating a cholesteatoma from other intracranial processes. \n\nTreatment: Surgical resection with either complete removal of the cholesteatoma matrix or permanent exteriorization is curative.  Depending on the size and location of the cholesteatoma a transtympanic, transmastoid, middle cranial fossa approach or a transphenoidal approach may be used.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"cholesteatomacongenitalear disease","Reference":"Congenital cholesteatoma: theories, facts, and 53 patients.

The long thin muscle body lies just deep to the lateral head of the gastrocnemius coursing inferiorly a few inches before terminating in the plantaris tendon.

The tendon may also insert into the distal Achilles tendon. \n\nThe plantaris muscle and tendon (as well as the gastrocnemius) is more prone to injury than the soleus muscle likely because it traverses two joints rather than just one.

It causes skeletal muscle weakness, affects both children and adults, and tends to affect women more than men.  A characteristic rash often accompanies or more often precedes the disease helping differentiate it clinically from polymyositis.  The rash is often heliotrope (blue-purple discoloration) and tends to affect the upper eyelids with associated edema.  A flat red rash on the face and upper trunk, as well as erythema of the knuckles with raised violaceous scaly eruption (Gottron Rash) may also be present.

Clinically most patients present with cough (usually chronic), recurrent infections and hemoptysis.  Although not a single disease process, bronchiectasis remains a descriptive final common pathway for several distinct disease processes.  Etiologies include:\nPost-infectious: Measles, whooping cough, TB and allergic\nbronchopulmonary aspergillosis)\nInflammatory: Association with Crohn\u2019s & Ulcerative Colitis\nCongenital: Bronchial atresia, Williams-Campbell syndrome, Cystic Fibrosis\nObstruction: Primary neoplasm, Foreign body, Enlarged lymph nodes\nImpaired Clearance: Kartagener\u2019s syndrome (Dysmotile cilia syndrome + situs)\nImmunodeficiencies: Hypogammaglobulinemia, alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\nPulmonary Fibrosis: Traction bronchiectasis \n\nAlthough findings consistent with bronchiectasis can be observed on routine chest radiographs and moreso on chest CT, dedicated high-resolution CT (HRCT) remains the modality of choice for the evaluation of bronchiectasis.  Although some authors report up to 7% normal chest radiographs in patients with bronchiectasis, even conventional CT may not delineate the etiology in a small percentage of patients.  Therefore, not only does HRCT delineate the location of the lesions in the lung, but remains the most sensitive and specific examination available. \n\nFindings on HRCT include:\n-Lack of bronchial tapering              -wall thickening \n- bronchial dilatation                   -mucoid filling \n-\u201csignet ring\u201d sign  with adjacent pulm artery as stone and bronchi as ring ie: relative enlargement of the bronchial \n-\u201ctram lines\u201d sign \n\nThree classifications have been adopted as standard which include: \n1. Cylindrical: bronchi have fusiform dilation and lack of tapering and presence of abrupt termination.-ABPA\n2. Varicose: usually has a more dilated bronchi than cylindrical, however will have bronchial constrictions that produce an irregular outline to the bronchi. \u2013 Cystic Fibrosis\n3. Cystic: thick-walled saccular dilatations that can have air-fluid levels secondary to retained secretions-Bronchial stenosis\n\nAlthough various disease processes have some regularity, there is some overlap and variablity of the type and location of the involved bronchi.  \n\n\nTreatment:\n\tAntibiotics and respiratory therapy are the mainstays of conservative therapy.  Surgical resection is an option of last resort for advanced disease.  Episodes of massive hemoptysis have been known to occur requiring emergent embolization of involved bronchial artery.  In the case of bronchiectasis in the setting of inflammatory bowel disease however the mainstay of therapy remains steroids as they lesions can undergo striking resolution once proper therapy is initiated.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"bronchitis","Reference":null,"Title":"Bronchiectasis"}}

Referred to pulmonary for evaluation.","Media":null,"Title":"Sarcoid","Treatment & Follow Up":"Unavailable."},"Topic":{"ACR Code":"-1.-1","Category":"Idiopathic or Unknown","Disease Discussion":"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in several affected organs. It is typically a disease of young adults, with a peak incidence in the third decade. The diagnosis is suggested by a combination of consistent clinical and radiological findings along with the presence of some nonspecific features such as depressed delayed-type hypersensitivity, abnormal immunoglobulins, hypercalcaemia, and elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme. It can be confirmed by biopsy evidence of widespread noncaseating granulomas. Pulmonary involvement accounts for most of the morbidity and mortality associated with sarcoidosis. The disease has a worse prognosis in blacks than whites, with a greater tendency for chronicity and multiorgan involvement.\n\nAbout 90% of patients will have an abnormal chest radiograph at some stage, showing lymphadenopathy, parenchymal opacities, or both. Other findings are uncommon and seldom occur in isolation. Sarcoidosis is traditionally staged according to its appearance on the chest radiograph: stage I, lymphadenopathy; stage II, lymphadenopathy with parenchymal opacity; stage III, parenchymal opacity alone. Low stages at presentation carry a better prognosis than high stages. \n\nLymphadenopathy is evident on the chest radiograph in about 70\u201380% of patients at some time during the course of the condition. Sarcoidosis is characterized by bilateral, symmetrical hilar and paratracheal lymphadenopathy. In 90% of patients with lymphadenopathy, nodal enlargement is maximal on the first radiograph and usually disappears within 6\u201312 months. In about 5%, however, large nodes persist more or less indefinitely, and these can be a source of confusion when found later with other incidental chest pathology. Recurrence of lymphadenopathy is virtually unrecorded. The lymph nodes may calcify, sometimes in a characteristic eggshell fashion. This latter feature is shared by only a few conditions. \n\nAbout 40% of patients presenting with nodal enlargement will develop parenchymal opacities, usually within a year, and of these, about one third will go on to have persistent (fibrotic) shadowing. Nodal enlargement does not develop after parenchymal opacities have appeared.\n\nParenchymal changes probably occur histologically in all patients but are only detected on the chest radiograph in 50\u201370% of cases. They may be classified as reversible, nonreversible (fibrotic), and mixed. Changes may resolve completely (two thirds of cases) or in part, leaving irreversible fibrosis. There are three major patterns of reversible opacity: irregular or rounded 2-4mm nodules, patchy airspace consolidation, or rarely 1-4cm irregular nodules. Characteristically they appear as the nodal enlargement is subsiding, in contrast to lymphoma in which these abnormalities tend to progress in unison. \n\nParenchymal opacities are well demonstrated on high-resolution CT. High-resolution CT is very sensitive and the findings are frequently highly specific for sarcoidosis. The principal abnormality is 1\u20135 mm nodules distributed in a perilymphatic fashion, predominantly along the bronchovascular bundles and subpleurally and, to a lesser extent, along interlobular septa.\n\nOther manifestations of sarcoidosis include pleural thickening and effusions. These are unusual though and do not occur in isolation. \n\nCor pulmonale, mycetoma formation and pneumothorax are all recognized complications of this fibrotic stage.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"SarcoidHRCT","Reference":"Grainger & Allison's Diagnostic Radiology: A Textbook of Medical Imaging, 4th Ed., 2001 Churchill Livingstone, Inc.","Title":"Sarcoid"}}

Up to 50% report viral illness or vaccination that occurred days to weeks prior to onset of symptoms.\n\nParsonage Turner syndrome presents as the acute onset of severe shoulder pain followed shortly thereafter by weakness of at least one shoulder muscle.  Bilateral involvement has been reported for as many as one third of patients.  It can be confused clinically with cervical spondylosis, rotator cuff tear, shoulder impingement syndrome, and acute calcific tendonitis.  Failure to identify PTS may result in inappropriate treatment or potnentially unnecessary surgery.\n\nPTS may involve single or multiple nerves originating from the brachial plexus.  The suprascapular is the most commonly affected (97% of cases), followed by the axillary (50% of cases) and far less commonly the subscapular and long thoracic.  In cases involving the suprascapular nerve, the supraspinatous and infraspinatous muscles are affected.  Inflammation of the subscapular nerve affects the subscapularis muscle.  The serratous anterior muscle is affected when the long thoracic nerve is involved, and the teres minor and deltoid muscles are affected in cases involving an axillary nerve distribution.\n\nThe MR finding most typical of PTS is that of diffuse high T2 signal involving one or more muscles innervated by the brachial plexus.  T1-weighted images may also show atrophy of the affected muscle(s). The pattern of muscular involvement should match the distribution(s) of one or more peripheral nerves originating from the brachial plexus\n\nNo test can be used to diagnose PTS specifically. Both electromyograms and MR images must be interpreted with consideration of the clinical history.  The disorder is self-limited, but can take up to a year to resolve.  Residual denervation can be seen in 10-20% of cases after 2 years.\n\n\nReferences:\n\nGaskins CM, Helms CA.  Parsonage-Turner syndrome: MR imaging findings and clinical information of 27 patients.

It is likely multifactoral including  genetic influence, dysfunctional immune response, enteric normal flora bacteria, and other environmental factors.  It is believed to be the result of an imbalance between inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators. Most cases involve the small bowel, particularly the terminal ileum. Crohn disease typically affects the bowel asymmetrically, involving the mesenteric side more severely than the antimesenteric border. Although any area of the GI system may be affected, the most common site of disease is the ileo-cecal region, followed by the colon.  Microscopically, the initial lesion appears as a focal inflammatory infiltrate around the crypts, followed by ulceration of superficial mucosa, then by deeper invasion and non-caseating granulomas. Grossly, the early abnormality is hyperemia and edema of the involved mucosa. Later, superficial ulcers form, which become deep serpentine linear ulcers located both longitudinally and transversely giving the mucosa a \u201ccobblestone\u201d appearance. The lesions are often segmental; being separated by healthy areas, hence the term \u201cskip lesions\u201d. Transmural inflammation results in thickening of the bowel wall and narrowing of the lumen. As the disease progresses, it is complicated by obstruction, fistula formation, abscess formation, adhesions, and malabsorption.\n\nClinical: The characteristic presentation of Crohn disease is with abdominal pain and diarrhea, which may be complicated by intestinal fistula formation, obstruction, or both. Unpredictable flares and remissions with a long course characterize Crohn\u2019s. Treatment is generally medical including antidiarrheal, anti-inflammatory, and sometimes antibiotics. Chronic complications include fistulas, adhesions, and marked luminal narrowing with partial bowel obstruction which may require surgery.\n\nRadiographic findings:\nRadiological evaluation includes diagnosis, evaluation of distribution, and evaluation for complications. The distribution of small bowel Crohn\u2019s disease is best assessed by enteroclysis and CT. The terminal ileum is nearly always involved in small bowel disease and is the only site in up 30 % of patients.\n  \nSmall bowel contrast studies: The sensitivity of enteroclysis is reported as very good in detecting Crohn\u2019s disease but often does not correlate well with disease activity. Superficial abnormalities include thickened folds due to mucosal edema, transverse and longitudinal ulcers, punctate collections of barium, and small nodules. Transmural abnormalities include deep fissures and penetrating ulcers.  Cobblestoning results from intersecting longitudinal and transverse ulcers with intervening heaped-up edematous tissue.  Deep ulcerations may result in fistulae. Thickened bowel may appear as separations of loops. Luminal narrowing is always present resulting from spasm and edema during the acute phase or fibrotic strictures in chronic disease. Ileitis can also manifest as a \u201csting sign\u201d on barium study secondary to spasm or fibrotic stricture fromation.  The mesenteric aspect and adjacent mesentery are commonly affected more than the antimesenteric border. Extramural mesenteric inflammation and abscesses may induce compression and displacement of bowel loops.\n\nCross sectional imaging: Both CT and MR imaging are reported to have a sensitivity of over 95% for the detection of Crohn disease.  At more advanced stages, CT and MR imaging can help identify and characterize pathologically altered bowel segments as well as extraluminal lesions including abscesses, fat stranding, and adenopathy.  Cross sectional imaging can also clearly depict inflammatory lesions and conditions that require elective gastrointestinal surgery, aiding in treatment planning.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"CrohnInflammatory bowel diseasestring sign","Reference":"1.

They usually lie in the sacrococcygeal area (50%) or the clivus (35%).  These tumors most often affect patients greater than 30 years of age.\n\nClival chordomas comprise less that 2% of intracranial tumors. They typically arise within the bone and are therefore extradural.  They also invade the surrounding bone and may extend to compress adjacent structures such as cranial nerves and the brain stem.\n\nClival chordomas are usually of a gelatinous consistency and may have secondary hemorrhage and necrosis. These changes can be present throughout the tumor.  \n\nMicroscopically, physaliphorus cells are seen, that contain large cytoplasmic vacuoles rich in glycogen and mucin.  These are separated into nests by fibrous sheets.  \n\nImmunohistochemistry reveals positive staining for cytokeratin and epithelial membrane antigen.  Chondroid chordomas, a more benign subtype, typically contains hyaline cartilage.\n\nBoth CT and MR are used to diagnose and delineate the extent of clival chordomas.  On CT, adjacent bone destruction is seen, and areas of low attenuation in the mass may represent the gelatinous matrix.  Calcification is occasionally seen inside the mass.\n\nOn MR, high signal intensity is seen on T2-weighted images.  These tumors are usually iso or hypo-intense on T1-weighted imaging with areas of occasional high signal intensity, representing blood or mucin.\n\nAfter administration of gadolinium contrast, these tumors typically demonstrate heterogenous enhancement, and typically have a \u201choneycomb\u201d appearance, due their lobular organization.\n\nMR also is useful to characterize possible internal carotid or vertebrobasilar encasement.\n\nTreatment for clival chordomas usually consists of a dual approach: surgical removal and radiation.  Depending upon direction of growth of the chordoma, a transphenoidal, transmaxillary, transbasal, cranioorbitozygomatic, or transcondylar approach may be used.  Occasionally, subtotal resection of the mass is performed, due to high risk of injury to adjacent neurovascular structures.  Potential complications include stroke, cranial nerve palsy, CSF leak, and meningitis.\n\nProton beam therapy has been the mainstay of radiation treatment for clival chordomas.  Any form of radiation is given postoperatively, and in most cases, traditional forms of treatment are avoided to limit the amount of injury to vital surrounding structures.  A study performed by Pearlman and Friedman showed an 80% local control rate with a minimum of 80 Gy and only 20% control rate with 40 to 60 Gy.\n\nAlthough histologically benign, clival chordomas have a high rate of recurrence, which may be related to sub-total resection.  Distant metastases are uncommon.  Survival rate approaches 50% at five years and 30% at ten years.  Greater extent of resection is correlated with improved survival.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"chordomaclivusskull base","Reference":"DeMonte F, Diaz, E, Callender D, Suk I.

These tumors are generally discovered incidentally at autopsy or imaging studies performed for other reasons (0.08-0.2% at autopsy). Extra-adrenal sites include the pelvis, thorax and retroperitoneum. They are typically unilateral and variable in size from mm to 30cm. There is an equal incidence in males and females with slight predilection in the Caucasian population. These neoplasms typically occur in the fifth to seventh decades, and no death rate is reported in the literature due to the rarity of these tumors. \n\nCT is the imaging modality of choice for these lesions which can be diagnosed macroscopically by focal fatty density within the mass. Occasionally, discrete calcifications can be found in small amounts along with a thin rim of residual adrenal cortex. MRI can also accurately depict both microscopic and macroscopic fat through chemical shift imaging and explicit fat saturation technique. Ultrasound is typically not used for the characterization of adrenal neoplasms, but has been known to find them incidentally. \n\nIt is believed that these tumors might represent an extramedullary site of hematopoiesis or that they arise from metaplasia of the reticuloendothelial cells of capillaries in the adrenal gland in response to stimuli (ie. necrosis, infection, stress). \n\nThese lesions are usually asymptomatic but might result in complications such as rupture (rare-only 11 reported cases as of 2003), tumor necrosis and retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and mechanical compression from tumor bulk. Myelolipomas do not undergo malignant transformation and they are rarely associated with endocrine disorders. However, Conn\u2019s and Cushing\u2019s syndromes as well as congenital adrenal hyperplasia have been documented in the literature (25 cases reported by one study). \n\nSmall asymptomatic tumors are generally monitored clinically while symptomatic lesions are treated by adrenalectomy. Large asymptomatic tumors are occasionally removed surgically to prevent rupture, and transcatheter embolization is used prior to surgery to stop bleeding of ruptured tumors. As most adrenal myelolipomas are small, asymptomatic, and discovered incidentally, surgery is rarely required.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"adrenal myelolipomaneoplasm, benignincidentaloma","Reference":"Andreas Meyer and Matthias Behrend, \u201cPresentation and Therapy of Myelolipoma,\u201d International Journal of Urology, 12.3:239-243, 2005.\n\nEdward M.

Evidence of bony remodeling and presence of a sinus tract indicated that this process was a chronic and possibly a congenital process. The midline location of this mass favors a dermoid rather than epidermoid which tends to occur more laterally. The presence of restricted diffusion on the DWI images suggested that this mass may represent an abscess or epidermoid. The presence of enhancement indicated infection which also fit the clinical picture.\n\nIn regards to cerebellar abscesses, treatment is dictated by the patient's clinical status, the size and location of the abscess and whether or not a capsule exists. Antibiotics with or without aspiration  or complete excision may be performed.\n\nOther diagnostic possibilities for a cystic posterior fossa mass include a cystic astrocytoma, hemangioblastoma, arachnoid cyst, and an epidermoid cyst. The presence of fat helps diferentiate dermoids from these other lesions. Intracranial lipomas are homogeneous fatty lesions and should not be confused with a heterogeneous lesion such as a dermoid.","Exam":"On admission, the patient was febrile and irritable.Physical examination revealed a palpable soft tissue nodule over the occiput.

This mass is low in density with HU measuring 17. There is rim enhancement with several internal septations. There is distortion of the 4th. ventricle with associated dilatation of the temporal horns.  Bone windows demonstrate smooth calvarial remodeling of the occiput with a small focal dehiscence within the bone that may represent a sinus tract. The overlying skin is unremarkable.  \n\nBrain MRI again demonstrates this intra- extraaxial posterior fossa mass with homogeneous increased T2 , decreased T1 signal. DWI demonstrates marked restricted diffusion which darkens on the ADC map suggesting an abscess, epidermoid,dermoid or other process with restricted diffusion. Mass effect with hydrocephalus is again demonstated. Findings are consistent with a multiloculated intra and extraaxial posterior fossa mass most consistent with cerebritis\/abscess. Given the bony remodeling and midline location, findings are most consistent with a congenital process such as dermoid which has become secondarily infected.","History":"21 month old male with high fever, mental status changes and possible seizure.","Media":null,"Title":"RSNA-COTD Infected Dermoid Cyst","Treatment & Follow Up":"The patient underwent surgery with the posterior fossa mass removed by neurosurgery.

Dermoid cysts(and epidermoid cysts) are not true neoplasms but are inclusions of ectoderm within the neural tube during its closure from the third to fifth week of embryonic development. \n\nIntracranial dermoids are rare. The posterior fossa is the most common location for intracranial dermoids, which can be found anywhere in the CNS. The lesions are most often midline and can have an intra- or extra-axial location.  When in the posterior fossa dermoids often have a sinus tract to the skin(dermal sinus) along with a defect of the overlying skull. The dermal sinus can allow the dermoid to become infected by providing direct access to overlying bacteria on the skin.\n\nPresenting symptoms can include headache, seizures, and cranial nerve deficits. The most common presentation is meningitis. There can be a painless lump under the scalp. Dermoid cysts are usually discovered during the first three decades of life with posterior fossa lesions often presenting in infancy and early childhood. Infection or rupture of a dermoid will lead to acute presentation of symptoms.\n\nThe CT appearance of a dermoid cyst is a unilocular, low attenuation, usually hetergeneous, well circumscribed mass. Hounsfeld Units below 0 help comfirm the presence of lipid. A heterogeneous nodule within the mass may represent matted hair. On MR a dermoid will be a hetergeneous mass with multiple regions of high T1 signal due to the liquified fat. If the dermoid has ruptured the high T1 signal will be scattered within the subarachnoid space. \n\nTreatment consists of surgical excision.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"dermoidsposterior fossa dermoid tumors","Reference":"Smirniotopoulos JG, Teratomas,dermoids, and epidermoids of the head an neck.

Causal factors include local (regional infection, trauma, neoplasm) and systemic (dehydration, hypercoagulable states, pregnancy, oral contraceptives).  Clinical presentation includes headache, neurologic deficits or seizures.  The superior sagittal sinus is most commonly affected, followed by the transverse and sigmoid sinuses.  Complications include venous infarcts, intracerebral hemorrhage and intracranial hypertension.\n\nOn noncontrast CT, the thombosed sinus is usually hyperdense.  This is nonspecific as dehydrated patients, adjacent subdural or subarachnoid hemorrhage or elevated hematocrit can cause increased sinus attenuation.  On contrast enhanced CT, the empty delta sign is a central defect from thrombus surrounded by contrast enhanced blood.  On MRI, absence of a flow void or abnormal signal within the sinus is seen. \n\nMR venography with two-dimensional time-of-flight is used due to high sensitivity for slow flow compared to 3D TOF.

Seen in both men and women, it is not typically seen in patients younger than three years old, and may be more common than previously thought.  Osteopoikilosis displays an autosomal dominant mode of transmission.\n\nClinical manifestations are absent or mild. In approximately 25% of cases, osteopoikilosis is associated with a specific syndrome such as mixed sclerosing bone dysplasia (coexistence of two or more of melorheostosis, osteopoikilosis, and osteopathia striata), Buschke-Ollendorf syndrome (osteopoikilosis and connective tissue nevi -dermatofibrosis lenticularis disseminata), and Gunal-Seber-Basaran syndrome (osteopoikilosis and dacrocystitis).  Additionally, dwarfism, dystocia, and spinal stenosis are other associations.\n\nRadiographic findings are diagnostic.  Numerous, small, well-defined, homogeneous ovoid or circular foci of increased density are clustered in a symmetric distribution in the epiphyses of long bones in a periarticular distribution or throughout smaller bones, such as the carpal and tarsal bones.  The sclerotic foci can also occur throughout the pelvis and vertebrae, and may increase in size with age until skeletal maturity is reached.  Complete disappearance of sclerotic foci has been observed.\n\nDifferential considerations include osteoblastic metastases, mastocytosis, and tuberous sclerosis.  The symmetric distribution, the predilection for the epiphyses and metaphyses, and the uniform size of the sclerotic foci suggest osteopoikilosis. Bone scintigraphy is useful in differentiating osteopoikilosis from bony metastases, as sclerotic foci of osteopoikilosis do not accumulate radiotracer in bone scans, unlike osteoblastic metastasis.  Positive bone scans are possible in children, and occur rarely in adults.\n\nHistologically, each sclerotic lesion represents a focus of lamellar bone containing haversian systems, and is identical to enostosis.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Osteopoikilos","Reference":"1.

Frequently plain flat and upright radiographs are the initial diagnostic study obtained to evaluate for obstruction. Radiographic signs of small bowel obstruction include small bowel dilatation (> 3 cm), differential (stair step pattern) air-fluid levels on upright films, and a paucity of distal bowel air. \n\nOnce a small bowel obstruction is suggested on abdominal plain films, CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis is frequently used to better differentiate between the vast array of possible etiologies. Adhesions, incarcerated hernias, intussusception, midgut volvulus, inflammatory disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease), and neoplasm (primary and metastasis) are all common mechanical causes of small bowel obstruction. By far the most common cause of mechanical small bowel obstruction is postoperative adhesion, accounting for nearly 75% of cases. \n\nSmall bowel volvulus is reported to account for 3.5% to 6.2% of small bowel obstruction in the Western world, with a higher percentage in Asia and Africa (increased incidence of parasitic infection and associated increase in gut motility).

Frequently plain flat and upright radiographs are the initial diagnostic study obtained to evaluate for obstruction. Radiographic signs of small bowel obstruction include small bowel dilatation (> 3 cm), differential (stair step pattern) air-fluid levels on upright films, and a paucity of distal bowel air. \n\nOnce a small bowel obstruction is suggested on abdominal plain films, CT of the Abdomen and Pelvis is frequently used to better differentiate between the vast array of possible etiologies. Adhesions, incarcerated hernias, intussusception, midgut volvulus, inflammatory disease (Crohn\u2019s Disease), and neoplasm (primary and metastasis) are all common mechanical causes of small bowel obstruction. By far the most common cause of mechanical small bowel obstruction is postoperative adhesion, accounting for nearly 75% of cases. \n\nSmall bowel volvulus is reported to account for 3.5% to 6.2% of small bowel obstruction in the Western world, with a higher percentage in Asia and Africa (increased incidence of parasitic infection and associated increase in gut motility).

Anomalous venous drainage of the left upper lobe is usually an isolated congenital abnormality that has no clinical significance.  Anomalous drainage of the right pulmonary vein to the inferior vena cava (scimitar syndrome) can present as a left to right shunt in patients with volume loss of the right hemithorax and a peculiar comma shaped density in the right lung base.  Anomalous drainage of the right upper lobe is associated with a sinus venosus type of atrial septal defect.  Left lower lobe pulmonary systemic drainage is associated with extralobar sequestration.\t\n\tWhen the left upper lobe vein drains into the left brachiocephalic vein, a vertical vein is seen coursing lateral to the aortic arch and the AP window.  This appearance must be distinguished from a persistent left superior vena cava.  The distinction comes from following the entire course of the vein to its drainage, and if you see two vessels in the left hilum or just one.  One is consistent with PAPVR while two indicates persistent left SVC (one vessel is svc other is normal left upper lobe vein.\n\tA persistent left SVC occurs in about 0.3% of the normal population with a substantially higher incidence in patients with congenital heart disease.  This anomaly results from embryologic failure of regression of part of the left common and anterior cardinal veins.  It at least drains the left jugular and subclavian veins.  On CT a persistent left SVC is positioned immediately lateral to the left common carotid artery and anterior to the left subclavian artery.  The anomalous vessel descends lateral to the aortic arch, in approximately the same coronal plane as the normal right SVC.

They most commonly arise secondary to abnormal hemodynamic shear stresses, and are not congenital as previously believed.  Berry aneurysms can also be associated with trauma, infection, tumor, drug abuse, AVM, and AVF. \n\n15-20% of cases are multiple.  They are found in the COW \/ MCA bifurcation 90% of the time.  Most berry aneurysms become symptomatic between 40 and 60 years of age, commonly presenting with subarachnoid hemorrhage, with an associated high mortality and morbidity rate.  The risk of rupture is 1-2% annually.  There is a 20-50% rebleed risk.  Larger size correlates with increased rupture risk, but there is no critical size that can be used to predict risk for bleed.  When a berry aneurysm is discovered, aneurysm obliteration is necessary, because of the poor prognosis for subarachnoid hemorrhage.\n\nCT:  In the case of a patent aneurysm, a well-delineated iso\/hyperdense lesion that exhibits uniform intense enhancement is demonstrated.  In the case of a thrombosed aneurysm, the residual lumen and outer rim may enhance strongly.  No enhancement is seen in complete thrombosis.\n\nMR:  Appearance can be highly variable, secondary to varied flow characteristics.  Patent aneurysms can demonstrate a hyper or hypointense signal depending on flow.  Wall enhancement may occur.  Thrombosed aneurysms demonstrate flow void signal surrounded by concentric layers of clot. \n\nReferences:\n\nCebral JR, et al.

Because the clinical diagnosis of internal hernia is difficult, imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) and small bowel follow through play an important role. Transmesenteric hernia is the most common type and is usually related to prior abdominal surgery, especially with creation of a Roux-en-Y anastomosis (eg, liver transplantation, gastric bypass). CT may allow confident diagnosis in most cases.\n\nWhen the small bowel herniates through a defect in the mesentery or omentum, the herniated bowel is compressed against the abdominal wall, with no overlying omental fat in most cases and at most levels of anatomic section through the herniated bowel. The herniated bowel tends to appear clustered and lies outside the colon, a reversal of the normal anatomic arrangement. As a result, the adjacent colon is displaced centrally (eg, transverse colon displaced dorsally, ascending colon displaced medially). There will be some degree of compression, crowding, displacement, and obstruction of both the bowel and blood vessels.\n\nThe herniated bowel may also twist within the hernia sac, which results in volvulus and a predisposition to bowel ischemia. Twisting of the mesenteric vessels, or the whirl sign, or twisting of the bowel itself is diagnostic of volvulus, and engorged blood vessels, mesenteric ascites, and bowel wall thickening suggest bowel ischemia.\n\nCT signs most suggestive of transmesenteric hernia are those that depict the abnormal cluster of bowel loops along the periphery of the peritoneal cavity and lack of omental fat covering the clustered small bowel.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"transmesenteric herniasmall bowel volvulusintestinal ischemia","Reference":"1.

They are not malformations.  They account for less than 3% of all intracranial neoplasms (1).  These tumors are most common  in  young  and middle-aged  adults,  where the incidence in males exceeds that of females (2).  The cerebellar hemisphere is the most common location, although they may be located in  the  spinal  cord,  brain stem,  or cerebral  hemispheres.    Ten percent of hemangioblastomas occur as part of the von Hippel-Lindau disease.\n\nSixty percent of these tumors are cystic, as in this case.  The enhancing mural nodule is a common finding in hemangioblastoma.  At CT,  the  cystic  portion of the tumor appears low density and does not enhance, while the  mural  nodule  enhances  homogeneously  and intensely.  The  MR  findings,  as  seen  in this case, include a predominantly cystic tumor with long  T1  and  long  T2  relaxation times,  and  intense enhancement of the peripheral nodule following gadolinium administration.  If the vascular nodule has bled  or  is proteinaceous,  it  may  be  hyperintense  on  short TR precontrast sequences.  More than one  enhancing  tumor  nodule  may  be  seen. Forty  percent  of hemangioblastomas are solid and display variable degrees of contrast enhancement.\n\nLateral  projections of a left vertebral artery subtraction angiogram (arterial and venous phases) in another patient with hemangioblastoma are shown in Films .6 and .7.  The angiographic findings are characteristic for a hemangioblastoma.  Notice the focal  enhancing nodule  fed  predominantly  by  the  superior cerebellar artery and seen densely enhancing in the arterial phase.   Because of  significant  artifact  in  the  posterior  fossa on CT, a small peripheral nodule may be missed and angiography is felt to be more sensitive  than  contrast  CT scan for detecting nodules.  MRI with Gd-DTPA may replace angiography for  evaluation  of  patients  with suspected hemangioblastoma.\n\nvon  Hippel-Lindau  disease  is  an autosomal dominant disorder with incomplete and variable penetrance (3).  The incidence is equal in males and females.  Multiple lesions have been reported in  this syndrome,  but  the  most important lesions which cause significant morbidity include retinal angiomatosis, cerebellar or  spinal  cord hemangioblastoma, renal cell carcinoma, and pheochromocytoma.  Over  50% of patients with this syndrome have hemangioblastomas of the retina, which may present with acute or  chronic  retinal  detachment.  Ophthalmoscopic examination reveals these lesions, and radiographic evaluation plays a small role.\n\nThirty-six  to sixty percent of patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease have cerebellar hemangioblastoma.  Signs and symptoms due  to  this tumor  are  the  most common cause for patients to present with the syndrome.\n\nAlthough  the reported occurrence of spinal cord hemangioblastoma is 5%, autopsy data  and  MRI  suggest  the  incidence  may  be higher (4,5).    Signs and symptoms of a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may be dramatic, and neurologic deficit from a spinal  cord  lesion may  be overlooked.  Typical MR findings in a spinal cord hemangioblastoma include syringomyelia,  enhancing  nodule,  and  enlarged feeding and draining vessels.  \n\nTwenty-five  to  thirty-eight  percent  of  patients  with  von Hippel-Lindau disease will develop renal cell carcinoma, which may be multiple  and bilateral.   Pheochromocytoma is found in 10% of patients with this disease.\n\nOther  lesions  in  von  Hippel-Lindau  disease include angiomas of the liver and kidney and cysts of  the  pancreas,  liver,  kidney  and epididymis.  \n\nRoutine  screening  of  family  members  of  a patient with von Hippel-Lindau disease has been  recommended.    MRI  with  Gd-DTPA  is  the procedure of choice to screen for CNS involvement.\n\nIn  the  adult, the  differential diagnosis for a cystic mass in the posterior fossa includes a simple arachnoid cyst or  a  cerebellar astrocytoma.

Chance in 1948, are horizontal vertebral fractures that extend through the vertebral body, pedicles and  to the spinous process or lamina.   The plain films are characteristic of wedge compression fractures while the posterior components are displaced to varying degrees.  The posterior displacements are often better visualized on MRI and more specifically CT.  CT with sagittal reconstructions are recommended.  \n\nChance fractures commonly occur at the thoracic\/lumbar junction where the spine transitions from a rigid to a more flexible segment.  The etiology of these fractures is most often hyperflexion of the back.  With the increasing use of lap seat belts in the 1950s-70s these fractures became known as \u201cseat belt\u201d fractures as vehicle accidents would cause sudden flexion of the waist at the thoracic\/lumbar junction inducing significant stress on the posterior column.  With the addition of shoulder belts these injuries have become significantly less common.  Most Chance fractures seen today are a result of falls or crush type injuries where the spine is acutely hyperflexed.  Intraabdominal injuries are likely in approximately 50% of chance fractures so vigilance should be given to a thorough evaluation involving a CT of the abdomen.  \n\nMost Chance Fractures are managed with immobilization.  Instability is frequently associated with a kyphosis of 20\u00b0 or more and a kyphosis of 30\u00b0 or more usually requires internal stabilization.  Main treatment for unstable fractures is surgical fixation with spinal canal decompression.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Chance FractureSpinetrauma","Reference":"Groves, Clare J; Casser, Victor N.  \u201cChance-Type Flexion-Distraction Injuries in the Thoracolumbar Spine: MR Imaging Characteristics.

It is an idiopathic disease most often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, particularly ulcerative colitis and less often Crohn\u2019s disease. It less frequently associated with Reidel\u2019s thyroiditis, retroperitoneal fibrosis, or mediastinal fibrosis. The disease is more common in males than females with a 3:1 incidence ratio. The estimated prevalence in Western countries is 6 to 8 cases per 100,000 persons.\n\nSeveral mechanisms have been proposed to explain the pathogenesis of PSC, however, it is remains an idiopathic disease. Bile duct walls become progressively inflamed and thickened and the degree of severity may vary segmentally.  There is typically alternating dilatation and stricturing of the involved ducts. The disease usually involves both the intrahepatic and extrahepatic biliary tree. It is characterized by progressive destruction of bile ducts, which may result in the development of biliary cirrhosis. It was previously thought to be a rare disorder, however, now PSC is one of the more common indications for liver transplantation.\n\nThe main symptoms of PSC include pruritis, jaundice, abdominal pain, and fatigue. However, as many as 44% of patients may be asymptomatic at presentation. Patients may also experience repeated episodes of bacterial cholangitis and have an increased tendency to develop pigmented biliary stones. Steatorrhea and malabsorption of fat-soluble vitamins may occur. Cholangiocarcinoma may occur in up to 30% of PSC patients.  2% of patient\u2019s may also develop hepatocellular carcinoma. \n\nThe diagnosis of PSC is based on characteristic ERCP findings in combination with laboratory, histologic, and clinical findings. It is important to exclude secondary causes of sclerosing cholangitis, such as prior surgeries, choledocolithiasis, chronic bacterial cholangitis and biliary neoplasms. The typical  ERCP findings of PSC include multifocal strictures and dilatations that have a beaded appearance. Biliary diverticulae may also be present. The intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts are usually involved, but either alone may be affected. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) also shows promise as a valuable technique in the diagnosis and follow-up of patients with PSC and MRCP may be superior to ERCP for the demonstration of intrahepatic ductal findings. CT and ultrasonography play a more limited role in the diagnosis or followup of PSC  and demonstrate nonspecific findings. \n\nMany modalities have been investigated for the treatment of PSC in an attempt to delay disease progression. Immunosupressants, corticosteroids, antifibrogenic agents, endoscopic management and limited surgical management are used with limited success. Liver transplantation is the only form of therapy that positively affects survival and up to 80% of patient\u2019s will experience significant quality of life improvement after liver transplant.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"primarysclerosingcholangitis","Reference":"Halpert RD, Feczko PJ.

Serology demonstrates monoclonal gammopathy.  Bone marrow biopsy pending pathologic analysis.","Differential Diagnosis":"Multiple Myeloma\nOsteolytic Metastatic Carcinoma\nHyperparathyroidism","Discussion":"This is a case of a 46 year-old black female with a history of sarcoidosis diagnosed at age 32 years, and bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome diagnosed within the past year now presenting with mulitple myeloma.  Multiple myeloma (MM) is a monoclonal B-cell malignancy consisting of terminally differentiated plasma cells.  In the United States, the incidence of disease is 3-4 newly diagnosed cases per 100,000 population per year, and represents 1% of all malignancies.  Demographically, patients are commonly African-American, with males slightly outnumbering females by 1.4-1.  Patients are typically elderly with a median age of 65 years at diagnosis, although cases in much younger patients have been reported.\n\nThe patient's presentation for MM is unusual given her relatively young age (46 years), lack of physical findings and history (i.e. fatigue, bone, recurrent infections), and laboratory abnormalities (i.e. hypercalcemia, elevated creatinine, elevated total protein) suggestive of  MM.  The bilateral lacrimal gland amyloidosis is a  unusual initial presentation for MM.  By comparison, lacrimal gland involvement in sarcoidosis is more common affecting 55-61% of patients at sometime during their disease course with similar findings on CT imaging.  Therefore, her management was based on the conclusion her presentation was a manifestation of her sarcoidosis and not MM.  The lack of response to therapy for the lacrimal gland enlargement ultimately prompted a biopsy of the gland six months from the time she sought medical attention, and one year since she reported initially having symptoms. \n\nThe lacrimal gland biopsy showed an inflamatory cell infiltrate, with nodules of pauci-cellular, eosinophillic staining material exhibiting apple-green birefringence on Congo Red staining.  This is consistent with amyloidosis of the lacrimal gland.  The lack of evidence of granulomatous disease present in the biopsy specimen strongly suggests that sarcoidosis is not the etiology of her lacrimal gland enlargement.  \n\nBased on the above findings, the patient received further laboratory and radiological investigations for the diagnosis of MM.   The diagnosis of MM is based on the demonstration of three components: 1) Serum or urine monoclonal protein identified by a characteristic monoclonal M protein spike on electrophoresis of urine and blood specimens; 2) >10% abnormal plasma cells on bone marrow biopsy; and 3) end-organ damage in the form of hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, sequelae of amyloid deposition, and\/or bone abnormalities on imaging.  Most patients will demonstrate symptomatic sequelae of of end-organ damage.  However, nearly 25% of patients with MM are discovered through incidental findings on laboratory studies and imaging. Indeed, radiographs provided the only significant finding suggestive of MM via a head CT that was obtained for the evaluation of URI symptoms of sinusitis in an emergency department several months prior to the lacrimal gland biopsy.  \n\nThe characteristic radiological feature of MM is the presence of a single osteolytic lucency (plasmacytoma), or, as in this patient's case, multiple discrete osteolytic lucencies (myelomatous) that are subcortical and found predominantly in the axial and proximal appendicular skeleton.  Lesions may also coalesce or take the form of diffuse osteopenia.  Sclerosing myeloma has also been described, although it is rare.  The osteolysis of MM is mediated by the secretion of chemokine factors by the malignant plasma cells that stimulate osteoclast proliferation, chemotaxis, maturation, and activity.  \n\nPlain film radiograph skeletal survey is the preferred diagnostic modality for the detection of bony involvement in MM.  Nearly 50% of the density of bone must be affected before the \"punched-out\" lesions are apparent, however, the presence of bone lesions is confirmed in 60-80% of all patients initially surveyed for MM with radiograph.  Other useful imaging studies include MRI, which may be used for the precise determination of lesion size and location for bone marrow biopsy, targeted radiotherapy, and for characterization of the extent of disease.  Imaging via CT is adjunctive to MRI for guided biopsy of lesions.  Recently, PET scanning has shown promise for monitoring disease recurrence by detection of lesions not readily seen on conventional radiograph.  \n\nDue to the osteolytic nature of MM, nuclear imaging via technec tium-99m (Tc-99m) bone scanning has no role in diagnosis or monitoring.  The sensitivity of Tc-99m scanning is dependent on osteoblastic activity, and therefore, underestimates the extent of disease.  Uptake of Tc-99m into radiographically abnormal regions is only 44% compared to conventional plain film.  This uptake is secondary to osteoblastic activity from pathological fracture, calcification within a plasmacytoma, or amyloidosis in association with tumor.  \n\nThe presence of osteolytic lesions is not pathognomonic of MM, as such findings may be present in a variety of conditions including other osteolytic metastases  and occasionally lymphoma) and hyperparathyroidism  Furthermore, bilateral lacrimal gland enlargement with homogenous soft tissue attenuation seen on CT is more suggestive of lacrimal gland sarcoidosis than other etiologies.  Neoplastic and infectious processes tend to present with discrete lesions within the lacrimal gland and\/or are likely unilateral.  The chronicity of symptoms also would argue against a bilateral infection, as such a condition would be likely self-limiting.  The apparent overlap of expected findings in sarcoidosis versus that of MM likely contributed to the lag between initial presentation and diagnosis.","Exam":"Physical exam: notable only for bilateral conjunctivitis and conjunctival hemorrhage and swelling \n\nLab:\nNo abnormal findings","Findings":"Head CT: Bilateral Lacrimal gland enlargement with homogenous tissue attenuation.

Ischemia is responsible for two-thirds of strokes, while hemorrhage causes about one-third.  CT or MRI provide a more definitive diagnosis than simply the history or clinical symptoms.  \n   Ischemic strokes can be caused by thrombosis or embolism.  Thrombosis more commonly occludes larger cerebral arteries, such as the ICAs, MCA or basilar artery, or the venous system.  These are generally preceded by TIAs, which give warning of an impending stroke and its affected territory.  The symptoms generally progress over minutes to hours.  Embolism usually occurs when thrombi pass to distal cerebral arteries from larger vessels such as the heart, aorta, or large cerebral arteries.  The symptoms at presentation usually do not progress further.   Hemorrhagic strokes can result in destruction or compression of brain tissue or vessels that then cause neurologic symptoms.  Some common causes are intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or subdural or epidural hemorrhage. \n   A patient who suffers from a cerebral infarct often has co-morbid conditions, broadly broken down into vascular, cardiac and hematologic disorders.  Common vascular disorders are atherosclerosis, inflammatory disorders (e.g., SLE, temporal arteritis) and migraines.  Arrhythmias, endocarditis, and rheumatic heart disease can lead to strokes.  Like this patient, sickle cell disease and hypercoagulable states can also result in strokes.\n   The middle cerebral artery is the most commonly occluded vessel in an ischemic stroke.  A stroke of the superior division will result in contralateral hemiparesis affecting the upper body (but not the legs), contralateral hemisensory deficit and if the dominant hemisphere is involved, Broca\u2019s aphasia.  An inferior division stroke may result in cortical sensory function impairment such as contralateral graphesthesia and stereognosis and disorders of spatial thought.

Ischemia is responsible for two-thirds of strokes, while hemorrhage causes about one-third.  CT or MRI provide a more definitive diagnosis than simply the history or clinical symptoms.  \n\nIschemic strokes can be caused by thrombosis or embolism.  Thrombosis more commonly occludes larger cerebral arteries, such as the ICAs, MCA or basilar artery, or the venous system.  These are generally preceded by TIAs, which give warning of an impending stroke and its affected territory.  The symptoms generally progress over minutes to hours.  Embolism usually occurs when thrombi pass to distal cerebral arteries from larger vessels such as the heart, aorta, or large cerebral arteries.  The symptoms at presentation usually do not progress further.   Hemorrhagic strokes can result in destruction or compression of brain tissue or vessels that then cause neurologic symptoms.  Some common causes are intracerebral hemorrhage, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or subdural or epidural hemorrhage. \n\nA patient who suffers from a cerebral infarct often has co-morbid conditions, broadly broken down into vascular, cardiac and hematologic disorders.  Common vascular disorders are atherosclerosis, inflammatory disorders (e.g., SLE, temporal arteritis) and migraines.  Arrhythmias, endocarditis, and rheumatic heart disease can lead to strokes.  Like this patient, sickle cell disease and hypercoagulable states can also result in strokes.\n\nThe middle cerebral artery is the most commonly occluded vessel in an ischemic stroke.  A stroke of the superior division will result in contralateral hemiparesis affecting the upper body (but not the legs), contralateral hemisensory deficit and if the dominant hemisphere is involved, Broca\u2019s aphasia.  An inferior division stroke may result in cortical sensory function impairment such as contralateral graphesthesia and stereognosis and disorders of spatial thought.  In the dominant hemisphere, Wernicke\u2019s aphasia may occur.  A stroke at the bifurcation or trifurcation will have superior and inferior divisional symptoms, plus homonymous hemianopia and global aphasia.  Finally, an occlusion of the stem of the MCA will logically be the most devastating, as it can cause hemiparesis of the entire contralateral side.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Cerebral infarct (L MCA territory)Cerebralinfarct","Reference":"Clinical Neurology, 5th Edition, Chapter 9, 2002.","Title":"Cerebral infarct (L MCA territory)"}}

This tendency frequently results in bullets seen on radiographs pointing toward their direction of travel and entrance wound.\n\n\nThis case demonstrates an unusual path bringing up another unintuitive situation called bullet embolism, which is a rare but well documented phenomenon.  With bullet embolism, the bullet travels through vascular channels; however, in our patient, the bullet traveled through both an air-filled channel (the external auditory canal) and a vascular channel (the petrous carotid canal).

Less commonly,  pulmonary hypertension may occur secondarily as the result of scleroderma, CREST syndrome, chronic pulmonary embolism or thrombotic disease, chronic left-to-right shunting, intravascular pulmonary metastases, or chronic parasitic infection. \n\nLess commonly, pulmonary artery dilation can be seen in the context of a congenitally stenotic pulmonary valve. The stenotic valve creates a high pressure jet of blood that results in post stenotic dilation of the main and left pulmonary artery. The right pulmonary artery is spared thanks to a sharp, 90 degree take-off from the main pulmonary artery that allows it to avoid the high pressure flow. \n\nAlternatively, a pulmonary artery aneurysm may be initially interpreted as concentric pulmonary artery dilation.

Additional CT findings suggestive of pulmonary hypertension include a ratio of pulmonary artery diameter to aorta diameter greater than 1:1, as well as decreased caliber of peripheral pulmonary vessels due to vasoconstriction, mosaic lung attenuation, and right ventricular dilation.\n\nIn the setting of pulmonary valve stenosis, the main and left pulmonary arteries are dilated, the right pulmonary artery retains normal diameter, and the right ventricle may be dilated due increased resistance across the stenotic valve. \n\nManagement and follow up for dilated pulmonary artery is dictated by the underlying etiology.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Pulmonary ArteryPulmonary HypertensionPulmonary Valve","Reference":"1.Castaner E, Gallardo X, et al.

In the United States, many patients with significant trauma are evaluated at a trauma center, resuscitated at that same center and receive definitive care all within one hospital.  In the military this is different as they may pass through many different facilities on their way back to the US for definitive care in a relatively short time.  A complete set of images may not always be available and the Radiologist must try to look at repeat scans to figure out what interventions may have been done prior to the patient\u2019s arrival and what are the remaining complications.  Often the patients may not be aware of what surgeries they have had because they were unconscious and are unable to provide accurate histories.\n\nThis is illustrated in trying to follow the even number rule of GSW\u2019s.  For each entrance wound, it is important to see either an exit wound or a bullet.  If we do not see a paired wound or bullet with an entrance wound it is important to keep searching because the bullet may have embolized or we are missing the exit wound.  In patients who have received care en-route it is possible to have a violation of this rule because the bullets may have been removed during previous surgeries at different facilities.\n\nThis patient had a repaired diaphragm laceration before reaching our facility which is evidence by 2 clips in the left hemi-diaphragm.  Penetrating diaphragm injuries tend to be smaller (length 1-2cm) and more subtle than blunt diaphragm injuries.  The signs used for detecting blunt diaphragm injury are not as useful in assessing penetrating diaphragm injuries.  One early and specific sign of PDI is herniation of abdominal fat through the injury into the thorax.  If a wound tract is seen on both sides of the diaphragm the specificity of this sign is reportedly 100% (sensitivity 36%).  The diaphragm can also be abnormally thickened when being compared to the contralateral hemidiaphragm due to hematoma, edema, or muscle retraction.  One must have a high index of suspicion when evaluation for penetrating diaphragm injuries.","Exam":"HR 116\/65, P 85, RR 16, T 97.6.

Diaphragm injuries are most easily diagnosed at laparotomy but not all patients have indications for an initial laparotomy.\n\nIn trauma, a chest radiograph is typically the first imaging modality employed.  This can be helpful in the initial evaluation for inspecting the integrity of the hemi-diaphragms but patient positioning and the quality of portable films can limit their usefulness.

Pulmonary Hamartomas contain cartilage surrounded by fibrous connective tissue with variable amounts of fat, smooth muscle, and seromucous glands.  Approximately 30% contain calcium in the form of multiple clumps (\u2018popcorn\u2019 calcification).  \n\nGenerally, pulmonary hamartomas can be observed by CT alone.  Indications for transthoracic biopsy or resection are rapid growth, a size greater than 2.5 cm, or new pulmonary symptoms. \n\nRadiology:\n\t\nChest Radiographs:\nWell-circumscribed, smoothly marginated solitary nodule without lobar predilection.  Most pulmonary hamartomas are  smaller than 4 cm in diameter.  Calcification is visible in less than 10% of cases.\n\nCT:\nWell-circumscribed nodule with a smooth or lobulated border.\nComposed entirely of fat, a mixture of fat and soft tissue, or fat and calcification.

This is a condition marked by thickening and fibrosis of the gastric wall with subsequent luminal narrowing, gastric wall rigidity, nondistensibility, and hypoperistalsis.  The most common site of gastric adenocarcinoma occurrence is the antral and pyloric regions (with variable spread proximally toward the gastric body).

Gastric Hodgkin lymphoma is much less common but will more often result in linitis plastica.  Hematogenous metastatic disease, most often from breast cancer, is another cause of linitis plastica.  Rare benign causes of linitis plastica include Crohn?s disease, sarcoidosis, atyplical infection (e.g., syphilis and tuberculosis), eosinophilic gastritis, vasculitis, corrosive agents, gastric irradiation, amyloidosis, iron intoxication, and hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy.\n\nhttp:\/\/www.orpha.net\/consor\/cgi-bin\/OC_Exp.php?Lng=GB&Expert=36273","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Gastric lymphoma M\u00e9n\u00e9trier&#39;s scirrhous carcinomamesenteric peritoneal metastasesLeather bottle stomach","Reference":"1.

Stones within the renal collecting system typically obstruct at one of three locations: the ureteropelvic junction, the pelvic brim, or the ureterovessicular junction.  Occasionally obstructing stones may also lodge at the bladder outlet.  When acute in onset, many patients with obstructing stone disease will present to the emergency department with acute flank pain.  The differential diagnosis consideration for such presentations can often include appendicitis, pyelonephritis, pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, tubo-ovarian abscess, and inflammatory bowel disease.  For this reason imaging typically plays an important role in diagnosis.  A study from Radiology in 2000 looking at the detection of ureteral calculi in emergency room patients determined that the sensitivity for stone detection by CT was 96%, and by ultrasound was 61% (both with specificities of 100%).\n\nIt is estimated that somewhere between 3 and 12 percent of individuals in the United States will experience symptomatic renal stones at some point in their lives.  The majority of stones (eighty percent) are composed of calcium (typically calcium oxalate and less often calcium phosphate).  The main other types include include uric acid, struvite (magnesium ammonium phosphate), and cystine stones.  Generalized risk factors for forming stones include low water intake, high protein intake, family history, urinary tract infection with a urease splitting organism (e.g. Proteus or Klebsiella), and disease states resulting in hypercalciuria, hyperuricosuria, or hypocitriuria.  Treatment of ureteral stones in the acute setting begins with adequate pain control. Once an obstructing stone has been identified within the collecting system, location and size of the stone plays a major role in determining management with stone size of 5mm typically representing the threshold for intervention\u2014with stones smaller than 5mm being managed conservatively (pain control, oral hydration, and urine straining for spontaneous passage), and stones greater than or equal to 5mm being managed with some sort of intervention (e.g. lithotripsy, cystoscopy, etc).","External Links":"www.fpnotebook.com\/URO116.htm","Keywords":"kidney stonesnephrolithiasisflank pain","Reference":"Shaefor DH, Hertzberg BS, Freed KS et al.

The peak age at presentation is between 20 and 40.  Approximately 50% of patients with AVMs present with symptoms caused by hemorrhage (25% present with seizures).  The overall risk of hemorrhage from an AVM is estimated at 2% to 4% per year, cumulative.  98% of AVMs are solitary.  Multiple AVMs outside the setting of vascular neurocutaneous disorders such as Rendu-Osler-Weber and Wyburn-Mason syndromes are extremely uncommon.\n\nPathology:  AVMs are complex networks of abnormal vascular channels that consist of dilated arterial feeder(s) and draining veins, without intervening capillaries.  These vessels often demonstrate flow-induced angiopathic changes secondary to endothelial hyperplasia (flow-related\u201d aneurysms in 10 - 20%).  AVMs may contain gliotic brain and hemorrhagic residua.  Atrophy of otherwise normal adjacent brain results from chronic regional arterial hypoperfusion and venous hypertension, as the AVMs steal vascular supply from adjacent brain tissue.\n\nImaging:  Intracranial AVMs are subdivided into parenchymal (pial or within the brain), and dural (outside the brain).  A mixed type occurs when a parenchymal AVM recruits dural vascular supply.  85% of AVMs are supratentorial.  On cerebral angiography an AVM appears as a tightly packed mass of enlarged feeding arteries that supply a central nidus, a plexiform web of small vessels.  One or more dilated veins drain the AVM nidus.  The main goals of the diagnostic imaging workup are to delineate the size of the AVM,  the eloquence of adjacent brain, and the pattern of venous drainage.  These 3 characteristics are used to determine the long-term risk of an untreated AVM, as the table below explains.\n\nTable 1.

In the foot and ankle region, it is seen more often in the distal tibia, talus, and calcaneus. A multicentric propensity has been seen in these locations. \n\nRadiographically, giant cell tumors are well-circumscribed, expansile, lytic, geographical lesions without rims of sclerosis, and they extend to the subchondral bone. On MRI, they demonstrate expansile contours, often with a rim of low signal intensity, which does not correlate with a rim of sclerosis on plain films. Internally, these tumors often demonstrate heterogeneous signal intensity as a result of the repeated episodes of internal hemorrhage and the formation of cysts and internal septations. Internal hemorrhage may lead to the presence of fluid-fluid levels, simulating an ABC. Sometimes, a giant cell tumor with ABC transformation can be found. MRI can be used to evaluate the articular and soft tissue extension of the tumor","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":"Stark, S. Bradley, W. Magnetic Resonance Imaging CD, 3rd Edition.

Administration of dexamethasone is usually initiated at the time of diagnosis and tapered to the lowest tolerated dose when radiation therapy is completed.  Due to the invasive nature of high-grade astrocytomas, complete surgical resection is not possible.  Therefore, surgery is only indicated to obtain tissue for pathologic diagnosis and control mass effects.  In patients younger than 65, the extent of tumor resection correlates with survival, so accessible tumors are resected aggressively in this population if the patient is otherwise healthy.  Following surgery, radiation therapy is administered.  Focal radiation has been shown to be as effective and less toxic in this patient population, and is administered to the tumor mass, plus a 3-4-cm margin.  A total dose of 5000 to 7000 cGy is administered in 25-35 equal fractions, 5 days per week.  Finally, chemotherapy is initiated.  This is only marginally effective, but is usually added as an adjuvant, following surgery and radiation therapy.

Staph and gram-negative infections are often nosocomial in origin.  \n\nPathogenesis usually involves aspiration as the mechanism to access the lung.  Periodontal disease often coexists.  Loss of consciousness\/gag reflex (alcoholism, drug addiction, general anesthesia, seizure, sedatives, neurological d\/o) and esophageal d\/o's increase aspiration risk.  Also a nasogastric tube, tracheostomy, throat and dental surgeries increase the risk.\n\nInitially, there is an area of pneumonitis or aspiration pneumonia that follows gravity.  Aspiration in the supine position more likely lead to pneumonia in the posterior segments of upper lobes or superior segments of lower lobes - often on the right.  Aspiration in the upright\/semi-upright position leads to basal segmental lower lobe involvement.\n\nSymptoms of an abscess are similar to pneumonia with fever, malaise, cough, pleuritic chest pain and sputum production.

The initial trauma is an acute osteochondral fracture. The knee is involved in 75% of all patient presentations. It is most common in young male athletes, with a male:female ratio of 2-3:1. It is rarely seen in patients younger than 10 years of age or older than 50 years. There are two forms of OCD, the juvenile form affects children with open physes between the ages of 5 to 15 years. The adult form is present in patients with closed physes. \n     With OCD of the talus, patients present with complaints of ankle \"catching\" with active motion or walking. They may have swelling or pain depending of the stage of lesion. On physical examination, patients may have diffuse or well-defined tenderness with a joint effusion, pain with tibiotalar joint compression, and\/or crepitus with dorsiflexion or plantar flexion.The cartilaginous and subchrondral bone lesions are usually on the posteromedial or the anterolateral talar aspect. \n     OCD of the talus is likely due to trauma causing tibiotalar subluxation with subsequent impingement of the talus on the tibia or fibula. Berndt and Harty observed in cadavers that impaction of the talus on the fibula in inversion with the ankle positioned in dorsiflexion results in anterolateral talar lesions. Posteromedial lesions could be created after inversion with a plantar-flexed ankle with resulting talus impaction and twisting on the posterior aspect of tibia.\n    Radiographs may be adequate for diagnosis but they may also show no findings. Radiographs should always be obtained, but if negative, an MRI  should be done for confirming the suspected clinical diagnosis when necessary. AP, lateral, and mortise radiographs are the standard radiologic images. Berndt and Harty's radiographic classification of OCD of the talus is used for determining the type of  treatment and the prognosis. Stage I is a small area of compression of subchondral bone. Stage II is a partially detached osteochondral fragment. Stage III is a completely detached fragment that remains in underlying bone depression. Stage IV is a completely detached fragment with displacement from the subchondral bone depression.\n     Canale and Belding recommend the following for all Berndt and Harty talar lesions:\nStage I and II - conservative treatment and protected weight-bearing\nStage III anterolateral \u2013 operative debridement and curettage\nStage III posteromedial \u2013immobilize limb in cast or brace and no weight-bearing for six months\nStage IV - operative debridement and curettage","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Talar osteochondritis dissecansOsteochondritisTalar trauma","Reference":"Resnik, Donald.

The disease was first described in 1931 and 1936 by H. Klinger and F. Wegener, respectively.  \n\nETIOLOGY: The cause of Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis is not yet known.  Granuloma formation, altered immune reactivity, immune complex deposition, and altered cellular immune responses are believed to play significant roles.  There may be a genetic predisposition. [1]\n\nINCIDENCE: In the United States, the disease frequency is approximately 1 in 30,000,  with mean age of onset of 40, equal prevalence in men and women, and increased prevalence in whites.  Old data indicated that the disease was rare in children and that children accounted for only 0.1% of cases, but the most recent NIH data demonstrates that children and adolescents account for approximately 15% of affected individuals. [2]\n\nPATHOLOGY: The classic histopathology in Wegener's granulomatosis is necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis involving small arteries and veins, most reliably found on biopsies of the lung. Upper respiratory tract biopsies, including the nasal septum, sinus, and trachea, most often show non-specific acute and chronic inflammation with or without giant cells and generally without true vasculitis.  Renal biopsies typically show focal segmental glomerulonephritis, with crescent formation and necrosis in more severe forms. \n\nCLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS: The spectrum of clinical features and organ system involvement in Wegener's granulomatosis is broad.  As a multisystem disorder predominantly involving the upper and lower respiratory tracts and the kidneys, clinical manifestations vary from \"classic,\" with sinusitis, serous otitis media, rhinitis with nasal ulcerations, cough, hemoptysis, and constitutional symptoms, to \"fulminant,\" with rapidly progressive renal failure and respiratory failure requiring intensive care unit management, to \"mild,\" with arthralgias, polymyalgia rheumatica-type symptoms, or inflammatory eye disease as examples. [1] \n\nSinusitis is present at initial presentation in about one half to two thirds of patients with Wegener's granulomatosis and is seen in 85 percent of cases during the entire course of disease.  A computed tomographic scan of the sinuses is often anatomically more informative than are plain radiographs, especially in the setting of destructive and erosive bone changes. \n\nAlthough laryngotracheal disease in Wegener's granulomatosis may be asymptomatic, clinical presentations may range from subtle hoarseness to stridor and life-threatening upper airway obstruction.  The most characteristic lesion is that of subglottic stenosis, which occurs in up to 16 percent of patients. In pediatric and adolescent patients with Wegener's granulomatosis, the frequency of subglottic stenosis is dramatically increased, reaching an alarming 48 percent. Direct laryngoscopy may reveal active erythematous, friable mucosa or bland scar.  Tracheal tomograms, computed tomographic scans, and magnetic resonance imaging may be useful adjuncts in the diagnosis of subglottic stenosis. Only 20 percent of lesions diminish with immunosuppressivetherapy alone, whereas 80 percent are fixed or irreversible owing to chronic fibrosis. [2]\n\n\nDIAGNOSIS: in the past 15 years, c-ANCA and its relationship to Wegener's granulomatosis have been studied. Clearly, this test is helpful in Wegener's granulomatosis, particularly during active generalized disease, and may be confirmatory. Because reports of false positives are increasing and because sensitivity varies from 30 to 90% in a clinician's diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, depending on the extent of disease and disease activity level, the test cannot be used as a sole diagnostic criterion for Wegener's granulomatosis. Radiologic imaging studies are helpful in diagnosing Wegener's granulomatosis, including chest and sinus radiographs and computed tomography. The differential diagnosis is quite broad and depends on the patient's signs and symptoms. When the classic triad of involvement occurs, with confirmatory tissue biopsy and a positive c-ANCA, the diagnosis is easy. When the process is early and\/or limited to the upper airway or kidney, the diagnosis is clinically challenging. [1]\n\nRADIOGRAPHIC FINDINGS:  Imaging studies of the paranasal sinuses may reveal characteristic findings in patients with Wegener's granulomatosis. Plain film findings include mucosal thickening, opacification, air-fluid levels, and bony sclerosis or frank obliteration . Computed tomographic findings include bilateral sinus opacification, orbital mass, bone erosion, septal perforation, and mucosal thickening [3]\n\nTracheobronchial involvement by Wegener\u2019s  manifests on CT as mural thickening and narrowing of involved airways.  90% of inflammatory lesions are located in the subglottic region with circumferential tracheal involvement and narrowing occur with a length of involvement ranging from 5 to 45 mm.  \n\nOn CT, the most common finding of pulmonary Wegener\u2019s is multiple irregularly marginated nodules, which can range from 2 to 20 in number and from 2 to 90 mm in size. Areas of opacification ranging from ground-glass attenuation to frank consolidation are the second most common CT pattern of pulmonary Wegener\u2019s and often represent findings of pulmonary hemorrhage . [4]\n\nTREATMENT:  Treatment depends on the severity and location of the disease.  A multidisciplinary approach is often needed.  Glucocorticoids and cyclophoshamide are the primary medications used for treatment.  Combination therapy with oral daily cyclophophamide and glucocorticoids is considered the standard therapy.  Methotrexate at times is used as an alternative to cyclophosphamide. Surgical treatment is often required to treat sinus disease, tracheal disease, and less frequently to provide renal transplant. \n \nPROGNOSIS:  Whereas Wegener's granulomatosis was once an invariably fatal disease, the combination of cyclophosphamide and prednisone has provided remission in 75% of all patients and improvement in 90%, as evidenced in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) series of long-term follow-up studies.

The two main types are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Although squamous cell constitutes 95% of esophageal cancers worldwide, adenocarcinoma has steadily increased to be the major histological type in the US since the 1970s.\n\nAdenocarcinoma affects white males in the 6th or 7th decade and is most commonly located in the distal esophagus.  Risk factors include gastroesophageal reflux disease and Barrett\u2019s esophagus where there is replacement of normal squamous lining with intestinal-type columnar epithelium.  Interestingly, these histological changes were found in patients without reflux symptoms. In a Swedish population-based study, 40% of patients with cancer did not have symptoms at least weekly.  In comparison, squamous cell cancer of esophagus is located in proximal-mid esophagus, affects black males, and is commonly associated with tobacco and alcohol consumption. \n\nCommon presenting symptoms of esophageal cancer are dysphagia, weight loss, GERD odynophagia, and dyspnea. These symptoms, especially any evidence of mechanical obstruction, should prompt an upper endoscopy where biopsies can be obtained. The primary tumor can then be imaged suing CT and endoscopic ultrasound. CT provides a general overview of the cancer and demonstrates adjacent organ involvement, although esophageal wall layers are not easily distinguished. EUS is gaining popularity due to its strength in visualizing the wall layers. Its drawbacks include operator skill and viewing \u201chard to reach\u201d tumors. \n\nOnce the diagnosis of the tumor is made, imaging to rule out metastatic disease should be performed. Intravenous-contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis remains the gold standard although sensitivity is dependent on the size of the lesion. MRI and US modalities can be used to further characterize metastatic lesions. Positron Emission Tomography is a new tool that visualizes the higher rate of glucose uptake by malignant tissue versus normal, thus, providing more information about metastatic disease. \n\nAppropriate imaging allows clinicians to properly stage the tumor, which directly affects the treatment options and prognosis. Well localized tumors can be resected and have the best 5-year survival of 65-85%. More invasive tumors and those with distant metastses are not surgical candidates and are treated with combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy for palliation. The overall 5yr survival of esophageal cancer is 12-15%.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nElton, Eric. \u201cEsophageal Cancer,\u201d Disease-A-Mouth, V51, N12 (2005) 664-684.\n\nKorst, R and Altorki,N. \u201cImaging for Esophageal Tumors,\u201d Radiologic Clinics of North America 43(2005) 611-619.\n\nPatel, A and Buenaventura, P. \u201cCurrent Staging of Esophageal Carcinoma,\u201d Surgical Clinics of North America 85 (2005) 555-567.","Exam":"H\/H: 13.1\/39.5 (low)\nChem Panel normal\nLFTs normal\nAmylase\/Lipase normal","Findings":"IV contrast CT of chest, abd, pelvis:\nA 6.1x4.5cm mass that extended into the proximal portion of the stomach was noted at the gatroesophageal junction.

The prevalence is often higher in rural areas, particularly where pigs are raised and poor sanitary conditions prevail. Humans develop cysticercosis by ingestion of foods contaminated with the parasites eggs (typically fruits & vegetables), not from eating pork infected with the parasite itself as is popularly believed. Thus, individuals who have never eaten pork can still acquire cysticercosis.\n  \nOnce eggs are ingested by humans, the embryos are released in the small intestine and invade the bowel wall. They then disseminate hematogenously and develop into cysticerci over a period of 3-8 weeks. Cysticerci are liquid-filled vesicles consisting of a membranous wall and a nodule containing the invaginated scolex. The scolex has a head armed with suckers and hooks and a rudimentary body. Humans with cysticercosis are incidental dead end hosts.\n  \nThe most prominent manifestations of cystircercosis infection involve the CNS, a syndrome referred to as neurocysticercosis (NCC) and it is thought to be the most common parasitic infection of the brain.  Clinical syndromes of cysticercosis are therefore often divided into neurocysticercosis and extraneural manifestations.\n  \n80% of neurocysticercal infections are asymptomatic. Consequently, many cases are found accidentally during imaging procedures or at autopsy. When symptoms due occur, they may be due to mass effect, an inflammatory response, or obstruction of foramina and ventricular system of the brain.\n  \nCysticerci that enter the CSF do not initially cause much inflammation. The host develops immune tolerance to the parasite, and cysticerci can remain in this stage for years without eliciting symptoms. Clinical manifestations frequently develop when an inflammatory response develops secondary to a degenerating cysticercus. It is not known what triggers this degeneration, but after a number of years the cyst loses its ability inhibit the host immune response. Peak presentation with NCC is estimated to occur 3-5 years after infection. After a variable period of degeneration, cysts become calcified and inactive. Once inactive, they may cease to cause symptoms or may serve as a focus for epileptic activity.\n  \nActive parenchymal disease is the most common form of NCC and is present in >60 percent of patients. Cysticerci tend to lodge in the cerebral cortex or basal ganglia. The cysts are usually <1 cm. Patients with parenchymal NCC frequently present with seizures, occurring in 50-80% of patients. In many endemic countries, NCC is the most common cause of adult-onset epilepsy. Because of NCC, the prevalence of epilepsy is almost twice as high in developing countries as it is in the Western world.\n  \nNeurologic examinations are usually normal, but focal neurologic signs or headache may be present. Patients rarely have fever or signs of meningeal irritation. If a patient has massive numbers of cysts in the brain parenchyma, an intense immune reaction can occur, resulting in encephalitis. This reaction can occur spontaneously or it can be provoked by therapy. This presentation is most common in children and young females for unknown reasons. \n  \nCysticerci that lodge in the subarachnoid space may grow to 10 cm or more since they are not limited by pressure from the brain parenchyma. Cysticerci can also develop in the ventricles of the brain, either floating freely in the ventricular cavity or attached to the choroid plexus, and is seen in only 10-20% of cases. Mobile cysts in the forth ventricle can occasionally cause intermittent obstruction, leading to episodes of sudden loss of consciousness related to head movements (Bruns' syndrome).    Involvement of the spinal cord occurs in approximately 1-3% of cases of NCC. Spinal cysticerci can be intramedullary or located in the subarachnoid space. \n  \nExtraneural cysticercosis typically involves the eye, muscle, or subcutaneous tissue. Patients with ocular involvement may have parasites located in the subretinal space or vitreous humor. These are often asymptomatic, but inflammation around degenerating cysticerci can threaten vision by causing chorioretinitis, retinal detachment or vasculitis and therefore this entity should be excluded before initiating therapy. Cysticerci also have a predilection for muscle or subcutaneous tissues, however, cysticerci at these sites are usually asymptomatic. \n  \nCalcified cysticercal lesions in muscle or subcutaneous tissue may be seen on routine skeletal radiographs or intracranial calcifications may be seen on skull x-rays.  Any case of suspected NCC needs to be evaluated with a CT scan or MR imaging. The appearance depends upon the location and stage of the lesions and upon the host immune response. In parenchymal NCC, viable cysts are seen as nonenhancing hypodense lesions. Degenerating cysts may enhance with contrast and may have variable degrees of surrounding inflammation. Old cysts often appear as calcified lesions.  MRI is preferred over CT scanning, since MRI is more sensitive in detecting small lesions, brainstem or intraventricular lesions, and is better at visualizing the scolex. MRI is also more useful in evaluating degenerative changes in the parasite. However, CT scanning is better at detecting small areas of calcification.\n  \nA number of different serologic tests have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of cysticercosis. Some tests detect anticysticercal antibodies, and others identify cysticercal antigens. Some can only be performed on blood, while others can done on other fluids, such as CSF or saliva. As with all serologic tests, results need to be interpreted with caution in individuals from highly endemic areas where a positive serology may be due to past infection and may not prove current active disease.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"neurocystircercosiscystircercosisparasite","Reference":"Leder K, Weller PF.

(MRI produces exquisite detail of the spinal cord. Most tumors are isointense or slightly hypointense compared to the normal cord signal. Contrast-enhanced MRI is very sensitive for tumors and may disclose minute lesions). This patient should be followed by neurology on a routine basis.  Any new onset in local or radiating pain, progressive weakness in the arms or legs, loss of balance and impaired bowel or bladder function should initiate a complete neurologic workup. Examination may reveal a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs. Lower motor signs may be at the level of the lesion and may aid in localization.  Other signs upon physical examination may include spine tenderness, stiffening of gait, trophic changes of extremities or sensory loss.  If the patient becomes symptomatic the benefits of surgical removal of the tumor(s) should be weighed against the intrinsic risk of surgery in this patient. Absolute contraindications to surgical intervention include uncorrected coagulopathy and systemic infection. Relative contraindications to surgical intervention include complete neurologic deficit over 24 hours and short life expectancy (which should be considered in this patient).  Additionally, although tumors that give rise to symptoms or those that become malignant are generally excised, if the tumor is on a vital nerve, excision may be impossible . Radiation therapy prior to surgery may be of benefit. \nNo laboratory tests are specific or sensitive to tumors arising from the spinal cord. Genetic testing may benefit patient\u2019s children."},"Topic":{"ACR Code":"68.316","Category":"Clinical Exam Finding or Sign","Disease Discussion":"Spinal tumors can be divided into extradural, intradural extramedullary, and intradural intramedullary. (each subset is briefly described below). The location of the soft tissue mass-like lesion in this patient is representative of an intradural-extramedullary tumor (ie. neurofibroma, meningioma or schwannoma- see discussion below).\n\nExtradural tumors:  usually metastatic and most often arise in the vertebral bodies. Metastatic lesions can cause spinal cord compression either by intradural invasion or, more commonly, by epidural growth that results in extrinsic spinal cord or cauda equina compression. \n\nIntradural-extramedullaryTumors: arise within the dura, but outside the actual spinal cord. They are usually nerve sheath tumors or meningiomas. \n\nIntramedullary Tumors: arise within the spinal cord itself.  The majority are gliomas, either astrocytomas or ependymomas, although metastases are recognized with increasing frequency. Although most spinal tumors are extradural, most primary spinal malignancies are intradural. The thoracic, lumbosacral, and cervical spinal canal is involved in 50, 30, and 20 percent of cases, respectively. \n\nIntradural-extramedullary Tumors:\nMeningiomas can arise from arachnoidal cells anywhere along the neuraxis and are occasionally found in association with neurofibromatosis.  Approximately 90 percent of the tumors occur within the cranial fossa and the majority of spinal meningiomas occur within the thoracic spine (of note: this patient has a prior hx of intracranial meningioma). The tumors are frequently adherent to the spinal dura, requiring dural resection for complete removal, and also grow along intradural and extradural components of the nerve roots. Spinal meningiomas are typically slowly growing invasive lesions and often erode bone. Rarely, the tumors may be considered malignant or aggressive if they demonstrate a proclivity to recur. The usual treatment for spinal meningiomas is resection; complete resection can often be achieved. The dural origin is generally cauterized and occasionally resected. Thoracic spinal roots may be sacrificed as necessary to obtain a complete resection; however, cervical and lumbar roots are preserved whenever possible. Subtotally resected lesions are generally followed expectantly for regrowth. Symptomatic recurrences are generally treated with further surgery.\nSchwannomas are generally benign lesions that arise from schwann cells that normally produce the myelin coverings of nerve roots. These lesions are slow growing and cause compression of nerve roots and other neural elements. The tumors can be intradural or extradural in location and are often dumbbell-shaped. Their biologic behavior is similar to neurofibromas (see below) but they do not, as a rule, invade the nerve. Schwannomas are generally encapsulated and may have both an extradural and intradural component and cause widening the neural foramina. Treatment consists of tumor resection, though sacrificing the nerve to ensure complete removal may be required. Additionally, complete resection may require removal of the facet joints and reconstruction of the spine may be necessary. \nNeurofibromas are biologically similar to schwannomas but the incidence is lower, except in patients with neurofibromatosis (see below). The tumors usually develop along peripheral or cranial nerves and are a central feature of neurofibromatosis 1, where they may occur intracranially or involve several spinal roots.  Involvement of peripheral nerves is manifest as firm, rubbery, subcutaneous lesions. Tumors found in association with the spinal nerve roots (as seen in this patient) are grossly similar in appearance to schwannomas. Nerve dysfunction may be caused by fusiform enlargement of the nerve with encasement of the axons by fibrous strands. Neurofibromas can be identified easily with MR imaging. The lesions are ovoid in appearance and increase in intensity with the administration of contrast material. CT myelography may demonstrate focal epidural compression at the involved site, and further delineate the tumor extent. The treatment for symptomatic neurofibromas is surgical resection. However, because there is usually no clear plane between the tumor and the nerve it is impossible to remove the tumor without sacrificing the involved nerve. The prognosis is good for the removal of a single neurofibroma. In cases of neurofibromatosis, the prognosis is poorer because of the multiplicity of lesions and the possibility that one of the lesions will undergo malignant transformation. \nNeurofibromatosis is an inherited disorder and is divided into two types. Neurofibromatosis 1 (von Recklinghausen\u2019s disease) is characterized cutaneous neurofibromas, pigmented lesions of the skin called caf? au lait spots, freckling in non-sun exposed areas such as the axilla, hamartomas of the iris termed Lisch nodules, and pseudoarthrosis of the tibia. It is associated with a mutation of a tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 17 that codes for the protein, rofibromin, which modulates signal transduction through the ras GTPase pathway. Patients with NF1 are at increased risk of developing nervous system gliomas, ependymomas, meningiomas, astrocytomas and pheochromocytomas. Neurofibromas may undergoe secondary malignant degeneration and become sarcomas. Neurofibromatosis 2 is sometimes called central neurofibromatosis. It is caused by a gene on chromosome 22. Bilateral schwannomas of the acoustic nerve and multiple meningiomas are characteristic.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Neurofibroma, likely neurofibromatosis type I.neurofibromatosis type I","Reference":"1.\tKleihues, P, Burger, PC, Collins, VP, et al.

PVT occurs in 10 percent of patients with cirrhosis and frequently accompanies hepatocellular carcinoma.  PVT may be associated with systemic or local infection or mesenteric inflammation.  PVT can complicate pregnancy, especially eclampsia, and conditions causing portal venous stasis such as hepatic venous obstruction, chronic heart failure, and constrictive pericarditis.  Encasement of the portal vein by pancreatic, gastric, and other malignancies can also lead to PVT.\n\nSigns and symptoms of PVT depend on the location and extent of the thrombus, how rapidly PVT develops, and the nature of any underlying liver disease.  PVT may lead to segmental atrophy and infarction.  It can be acutely fatal when associated with mesenteric vein thrombosis.  Collateral channels form and the portal vein recanalizes (cavernous transformation) in 1\/3 of patients in whom PVT develops slowly (subacute or chronic).  Portal vein thrombosis can cause or exacerbate portal hypertension.\n\nAs in this case, the predominant clinical feature is often the underlying disease.

It is a benign bone lesion, seen most commonly in the second and third decades, with a male to female predilection of approximately 2 to 1(3,4).  Of all the chondromas, periosteal chondroma accounts for less than 2% of cases(5).  The most common locations for this lesion are the metaphysis or diaphysis of the proximal humerus and distal femur(2-4).\nPeriosteal chondroma presents as a well demarcated, ossific mass in a juxtacortical position, with or without sclerotic borders and not continuous with the medullary cavity(2,4).  Periosteal chondroma exhibits a characteristic saucerization of the underlying cortex(3).  T1 weighted MRI imaging typically reveals a hypointense signal, and T2 weighted imaging shows a hyperintense signal.  In addition, MR imaging reveals that this lesion does not show soft tissue involvement or continuity with the medullary cavity(6).  \nHistologically, periosteal chondroma appears as a lobulated fibrocartilaginous matrix on low power.  Higher power reveals lobules of chondrocytes, sometimes showing atypia such as binucleation (2,4,7).  Ossification and calcification may also be present. \nSurgical excision is the treatment of choice(2,4,7), primarily due to the similarity to malignant lesions like osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. In addition, it may cause symptoms in the hand such as restricted range of motion or local pain and tenderness. Periosteal chondroma typically has a low rate of recurrence, particularly when excising the underlying periosteal tissue and any suspicious appearing cortex(2,3,8).","External Links":null,"Keywords":"periostealchondroma","Reference":"1.

The causes for which are many, for instance, alcoholism, obesity, malnutrition, steroid therapy, and diabetes mellitus. Laboratory testing of liver function tests could aid in further diagnosis.  CT imaging is consistent with this diagnosis as the liver appears less dense than the spleen.  Given that the liver findings were discovered incidentally and the patient has been asymptomatic there is no need to aggressively pursue this with further imaging or biopsy.  However, from a medical record review, the patient reported that her primary care manager requested that she be taken off acetaminophen because of high liver function tests.  The results of this test were unavailable. So significant delay in diagnosis could lead to long-term liver damage.  Furthermore, most cases of fatty liver disease will resolve if the etiology is discovered and the offending agent is removed.\n\nThe appearance of focal fatty sparing is concerning and could misinterpreted as liver tumor, primary of metastasis.

These agents and states include corticosteroids, chemotherapy, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, hepatotoxic drugs, obesity, severe hepatitis, chronic alcoholism, malnutrition \/ malabsorption, jejuno-ileal and jejunocolic bypass surgery, hyperalimentation, congestive heart failure, and blunt hepatic trauma.  Despite these associations, the exact pathophysiologic mechanisms remain obscure.  Possibly diminished portal venous perfusion has a significant effect on producing fatty change and altering hepatic density.  A relative hepatocellular ischemia is proposed to result in decreased parenchymal glycogen and increased accumulations of fat.  The fat content of the liver may rise as high as 40% - 50% of the weight, well above the normal value of approximately 5%.\nRegional variation in amount of liver-cell fat can produce entities called pseudolesions or pseudotumors, usually discovered during imaging. Focal fatty sparing in an otherwise fatty liver  occurs in several typical locations: along the gallbladder fossa, along the falciform ligament, occasionally in the periphery of the liver and near the hilum which is perfused with low-insulin blood from a pyloric vein. Because focal fatty sparing can only occur in the presence of fatty liver disease, most of these patients have a history of one of the disease states or agent exposures mentioned above.\n\nClassic features that will help differentiate focally fatty sparing from a hypoechoic mass are that it occurs in these typical locations, often has a geographic (triangular or quadrangular) shape vice being round like most masses and focally fatty sparing, since it is not a mass, will not demonstrate mass effect on adjacent structures, particularly crossing vessels.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Hepatic fatty infiltration with focal sparingLiver fatty infiltrationfocal sparing","Reference":"Wanless IR.

It frequently co-exists with other pelvic diseases.  It represents focal or diffuse invasion of the basal endometrium into the myometrium causing a reactive hyperplasia amidst small foci of entrapped glandular elements and hemorrhage.   Basal endometria is not responsive to menstrual cycle hormonal fluctuations and thus the thickness of the endometrial layer does not vary with the menstrual cycle.  The disease is sometimes referred to as \u201cendometriosis interna\u201d.\n\nWomen with adenomysis present with the nonspecific symptoms of menorrhagia and dysmenorrhea.   The prevalence of the disease is 8.8 \u2013 30% and is found in about 30% of hysterectomy specimens.  Between 60 \u2013 80% of patients have other pelvic disorders such as leiomyoma (35-55%) and endometriosis (36-40%).\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging and transvaginal ultrasound are the best modalities with which to study adenomyosis.  MRI has the advantage of better contrast resolution, larger field of view and superior sensitivity (88 \u2013 93%) and specificity (66 \u2013 91), but at a substantially greater financial cost.   The MR image will show loss of the normal uterine junctional zone.  It is instead expanded and replaced with focal or diffuse low T1 and T2 tissue signal, the thickness of which correlates well with the severity of adenomyosis.  A junctional zone thickness of between 10 \u2013 12 mm is a commonly accepted criterion for diagnosis.  A requirement for greater thickness provides increased specificity.  The low T2 signal is due to the proliferation of reactive smooth muscle elements in response to the endometrial invasion and a generally decreased vascularity of these areas.  Linear striations of high T2 signal radiating from the endometrium are specific for adenomyosis.  One may also see small foci of increased T2 signal.  These are thought to represent small endometrial cysts, hemorrhage or endometrial tissue.  This finding adds specificity to the imaging study.\n\nContrast enhanced sequences are not typically necessary.

Lynch I has no history of associated cancers.  Lynch II often presents with other cancers most commonly of ovarian or uterine origin. Both types are predisposed to a higher frequency of proximal colonic tumors with advanced pathology compared to typical colon cancer. \n\nHNPCC typically presents during the fourth and fifth decades and characterized by adenomas that progress much more rapidly to carcinoma than typical.  These are not as numerous as those in Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).  It also has a more heterogenous genetic basis than FAP, with most cases linked to chromosomes 2,3, and 7.  As such, the diagnosis is often based upon familial history of early colorectal cancer presentations (prior to 50 years of age).\n\nGenetic testing is often difficult secondary to multiple site mutations and is positive in approximately 80% of affected individuals.  However, agressive surveillance of all first degree relatives of individuals clinically suspected to have the syndrome is warranted.\n\nScreening should begin at age 20 to 25 consist of colonoscopy every other year.  Alternatively, genetically positive individuals should be considered for prophylactic colectomy.

In the case of colon cancer, it often presents as an intraluminal filling defect with bowel wall thickening and adjacent inflammation (fat stranding).  It is often focal and is frequently accompanied by adjacent lymphadenopathy.  It can be difficult to differentiate this entity from diverticulitis which can also present with similar findings.  However, the wall thickening and pericolonic inflammation are more likely to be focal in colon cancer, whereas it more likely to involve larger segments in diverticulitis (greater than 10 CM).

Some believe that hemangiomas are neoplasms while others consider them hamartomas.  Abnormal angiogenesis involving cytokines, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is suspected. They most often occur in the skin or subcutaneous tissues. Visceral hemangiomas are much less common but may result in organ dysfunction. They also occur in deep soft tissues and bones. Other diseases are associated with hemangiomas. Gorham disease is a process of massive osteolysis, which is believed to be within the spectrum of hemangiomatous disease. Hemangiomas occurring with multiple enchondromas exist in Maffucci syndrome.\n\nSkeletal muscle is the most common site for hemangioma of the deep soft tissue. Intramuscular hemangiomas are often asymptomatic or painless and found as an incidental finding.  They may become symptomatic causing pain and swelling.   Intramuscular hemangiomas are most commonly found in young people, virtually equal in males and females. The most common location is the thigh.  The symptoms of pain and swelling due to increased blood flow through the hemangioma are often exacerbated by exercise, which results in vascular dilation. Rarely, large intramuscular hemangiomas may be associated with significant shunting of blood flow even leading to heart murmurs and\/or congestive heart failure similar to that of an arteriovenous fistula. \n\nImaging:  Plain film radiography of soft tissue hemangiomas may demonstrate soft tissue density without or with phleboliths.  They may cause benign-appearing periosteal reaction or chronic cortical thickening and remodeling in adjacent bone. Cortical changes may include erosions, thickening, tunneling, and osteopenia. Phleboliths within the soft tissue mass are diagnostic but uncommon. MRI is the imaging modality of choice in concert with plain films. Hemangiomas show increased signal on both T1 and T2 weighted images, frequently with areas of signal void, which may represent fibrous tissue, phleboliths, thrombi or high flow.  These signal characteristics with a serpentine pattern of vessels and interspersed fat are diagnostic. Gadolinium enhancement is also noted.  Features separating hemangiomas from malignant soft tissue tumors include frequency of lobulation, septation, and central low-intensity dots on T2-weighted images. Hemangiomas tend to enhance markedly compared with malignant soft-tissue tumors.  Angiography demonstrates a highly vascular lesion with parallel oriented vessels. \n\nTreatment: The natural course of intramuscular hemangiomas is usually fatty replacement with gradual involution. Therefore, conservative observation is appropriate if symptoms are absent or mild.  If symptoms dictate treatment, embolization may be used to provide symptomatic relief of intramuscular hemangiomas. When surgical excision is required, embolization may be used preoperatively to decrease blood loss and recurrence. Excision can provide permanent relief. However, it is usually restricted to hemangiomas contained within a single muscle.  If complete resection is not possible they nearly always recur. Radiation has been used as a non-surgical therapy.  Chemotherapy has been used for extensive hemangiomatosis.  Steroids have been used for some of the syndromic versions.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Intramuscular hemangiomahemangiomatosis","Reference":"1.

The usual age of presentation is 20-40 years of age after the growth plate has been obliterated. Patients usually present with tenderness and swelling over the primary site and rarely pathologic fracture. GCTs comprise 5-9% of all primary bone tumors, 25% of benign bone tumors and are the 6th most common primary bone neoplasm. The majority of GCTs are benign with approximately 5-10% malignant, which are indistinguishable radiographically.  60% occur in the long bones and almost all GCTs involve the articular end of the bone with the following most common sites: proximal tibia, distal femur, distal radius and proximal humerus.   \n\nInitial evaluation is usually with radiography, which  often reveals a geographic, well-defined lucent lesion usually lacking sclerotic margins or periosteal reaction.  The lesion is usually in an eccentric location and usually extends to the articular surface.  Further evaluation requires CT or MRI, which can demonstrate associated soft tissue mass and full extent of the lesion.  MRI is useful in defining the full extent of the tumor in preparation for surgical resection and may occasionally reveal fluid\/fluid levels or subchondral breakthrough or joint involvement. \n\nTreatment consists of surgical curettage with bone grafting or orthopedic cement or wide resection with secondary implantation of an allograft endoprosthesis.  Pathologic evaluation reveals vascular tissue with mononuclear stromal cells and multinucleated giant cells of osteoclast type.  Recurrence is frequent (approximately 50%) and usually due to inadequate surgical resection. Recurrence is often manifested radiographically by resorption of the bone graft and appearance of new lucenies.  Malignant degeneration may occur especially following radiation therapy.

These are carried by dogs, sheep and cattle.  The disease is rare in the United States, with only about 200 cases a year reported, mostly in the southwest and Alaska.  The disease is acquired as a child, with a latent period of 5 to 20 years  before signs or symptoms are noted.  The cysts continue to grow, eventually causing mechanical compression which leads to most symptoms.  Sixty percent of all these cysts are found in the liver, 25% in the lung, and 15% in the peritoneum, kidney, spleen, and retroperitoneum combined.  If the cysts of E. Granulosus rupture, they can cause an anaphylactoid reaction.  Theoretically, therefore, these masses should not be drained percutaneously.  In practice, however, some have been inadvertently punctured without complications.\n\nHydatid disease presents in four basic ultrasound patterns.  The first and most common is the cystic pattern, a round, anechoic, well-defined mass with smooth walls and posterior acoustic enhancement.  In 60% of cases, there is more than one parent cyst.  Some cysts may have septa dividing the cyst into numerous sections.  Occasionally the cysts may become infected.  With age, the cyst may collapse away from the edge of the cavity and may even fold in upon itself, forming what has been called the matrix.  This type of cyst cannot be differentiated from congenital cysts, traumatic cysts, or a cavitating tumor.  A second pattern, the racemose pattern,  has the parent cyst with daughter cysts (the pattern seen in this case).  The daughter cysts can be any number and appear round until they are so numerous that they become irregular and flat.  A third pattern consists of a solid mass that can be hypoechoic, hyperechoic, or isoechoic.  A fourth pattern presents with calcified walls.  Due to acoustic shadowing, a complete examination is often difficult.  However, by using different planes of section and varying the frequency and gain, the interior can usually be examined.  The interior is usually anechoic but may also be calcified.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"liverechinococcosiscyst","Reference":null,"Title":"Echinococcal cyst (hydatid disease) of the liver"}}

These include compression, burst, Chance (\"seatbelt\"), and fracture-dislocation.  \n\nCompression fractures show anterior column compression (anterior vertebral body) with usually no middle or post column involvement.  Burst fractures produce anterior and middle column compression (vertebral body and anterior neural arch).  Fracture-dislocations involve all three (anterior, middle, and posterior) columns which results in intervertebral subluxation or dislocation.\n\nChance or Chance-type fractures involve the posterior, middle, and occasionally the anterior columns.  The injury results from a severe flexion of the spine with the fulcrum not being the the anterior vertebral body as in compression fractures.  Instead, the anterior abdominal wall (i.e. where the lap seatbelt fits) is the fulcrum area with hyperflexion at thoraco-lumbar junction (e.g. L1). This creates a distraction force on the posterior and middle columns of the vertebra,  creating a horizontal fracture extending posterior to middle.  This fracture may then extend anteriorly throught vertebral body (with an assoc compression of anterior body).\n\nChance fracture is an  \u201ceponym\u201d, named after G.Q. Chance who described this injury in 1948 as anterior wedging, compression, and a frature through the body, lamina, and spinous process.  Because of the mechanisms of injury (flexion over a seat belt) about \u00bd are associated with intra-abdominal trauma.\n\nBurst and fracture dislocations have a high incidence of instability.  Chance fractures also have potential for instability although not as likely as the former two.  Since radiographs may not clearly demonstrate the exact plane and extent of this fracture, CT (with sagital reconstruction is quite useful).  Axial spine CT alone often won't delineate the fracture well due the fracture's horizontal (axial) nature.  MRI can help determine cord compression and injury.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Chance seat belt hyperflexion spine vertebra","Reference":"Resnick,D: BONE AND JOINT IMAGING, 2nd Ed. pp 810-813.\nEismont,FJ: Flexion-Distraction Injuries of the Thoracic and Lumbar Spine, SPINE TRAUMA 1998; 402-414.","Title":"Chance-type fracture"}}

They consist of large sinusoidal vascular spaces which lack normal endothelial tight juctions.  As a result, bleeding is frequent.  The majority of bleeds from these lesions, however, are subclinical with nearly 100% demonstrating hemosiderin staining of the adjacent parenchyma at diagnosis.  There is a 0.5-1% incidence of symptomatic hemmorhage\/year.  The most common clinical presentation as a result of hemmorhage is the development of seizures or progressive neurologic deficits, with a seizure disorder being the presenting symptom in approximately 50% of patients with cavernous angiomas.  The degree to which a lesion is symptomatic is,like most CNS abnormalities, dependent on location. Brainstem lesions tend to present earlier with neurologic deficits.\n\nCavernous angiomas may occur anywhere within the CNS with roughly 3\/4 occurring supratentorially, 1\/4 within the posterior fossa and brainstem, and occasional lesions within the spinal cord.  While the occurrence may be sporadic, there is a strong familial association identified where close to 80% of members of affected families may demonstrate lesions.  In about 50% of patients the lesions will be multiple.  Whenever more than one cavernous malformation is identified in the CNS, there is probably an autosomal dominant inheritence.  This should prompt an evaluation of all first-degree relatives.\n\nImaging findings are related to the degree of prior hemmorhage of the lesions.  On CT, these lesions may be heavily calcified.  MR often demonstrates blood products of various ages centrally and a rim of hemosiderin peripherally.  Gradient-echo images may be helpful in identification of small lesions secondary to the gradient suseptibility or characteristic \"blooming\" artifact produced by hemosiderin.

It is an aggressive and usually fatal tumor. Most pancreatic cancers occur in the pancreatic head (60%)and less commonly in the body (15%) or tail (5%).  20% diffusely involve the entire gland. The overall 5 year survival rate is less than 5%. The only realistic hope for cure is in early detection and aggressive surgery (Whipple procedure). Imaging modalities utilized in the detection and evaluation of pancreatic carcinoma include ultrasound, MRI, and CT.\n\nThe sensitivity and specificity of transabdominal ultrasound for the detection of pancreatic carcinoma approaches 90% in advanced cases, with much lower sensitivity and specificity in early stage disease. Small carcinomas (2 to 3cm) are solid, hypoechoic, and ill-defined.  Larger tumors are more heterogeneous with well defined, lobulated, or irregular margins.  Ultrasound may also detect calcifications, ductal dilatation and fluid collections. Pancreatic carcinoma may be surrounded by chronic pancreatitis and ultrasound is not very useful in differentiating the two.\n\nContrast enhanced CT is the most frequently performed study for the evaluation of pancreatic carcinoma.  Characteristic findings include a minimally enhancing, hypodense mass that commonly produces the \"double-duct\" sign - a dilated common bile duct and pancreatic duct. The uncinate process often appears blunted.  There may be stranding in the peripancreatic mesentery signaling peri-pancreatic invasion. Vascular encasement of the nearby superior mesenteric vessels, portal vein, hepatic artery, or celiac trunk renders the tumor inoperable. \n\nMRI can be used to correlate CT findings and for surgical staging. MRI has a similar sensitivity to CT for detecting peri-pancreatic and vascular invasion.  On non-contrast MR imaging, pancreatic carcinomas are typically hypointense on T1 weighted images and hyperintense on T2 weighted images, With gadolium MRI, the most prominent enhancement of the lesion occurs 15 seconds after injection.","External Links":"www:\/\/lef.org\/protocols\/prtcls-txt\/t-prtcl-113.html","Keywords":"PancreaticCarcinomaImaging","Reference":"Nishiharu, Taiji, et al.

This system uses radiologic findings from CT or ultrasound to classify renal \"cysts\" into four categories.\nIsrael & Bosniak - http:\/\/radiology.rsnajnls.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/236\/2\/441\nTable of Classes - http:\/\/radiology.rsnajnls.org\/cgi\/content-nw\/full\/236\/2\/441\/T1\n\u2022  Class 1:\n\u00bb Homogeneous water attenuation\n\u00bb No internal architecture\n\u00bb No enhancement\nThe first category includes only simple cysts that are homogeneous, have well defined margins, are -10 to +20 Hounsfield units in density (like that of water), do not contain septa, calcifications, nor solid components; and, they do not enhance with contrast.  This is the most common category, occurring in at least 50% of the population over 50 years of age.  This is also the most benign category and requires little if any follow-up.\n\n\u2022  Class 2:\nThe second category includes simple cysts that may have additional radiologic findings.  Findings that will increase the classification from Class 1 to Class 2 include:\n\u00bb  the presence of thin hyaline septa\n\u00bb  mild calcification in the cyst wall or in the thin septa\n\u00bb  uniform hyperdensity\n\nThese have < 5% chance of malignancy and often are not provided follow up.\n\nThere has been much controversy in the literature about inter-observer variability when it comes to the distinguishing between class 2 and class 3 cysts.  This forced the classification system to give rise to a new category so as to more accurately describe the range between Class 2 and Class 3 cysts. \n \n\u2022  Class 2F (meaning \"needs follow-up\"): \n\u00bb  multiple thin septa that may have mild or moderate nodular calcification\n\u00bb  mild thickening of the wall or septa\n\u00bb  minimal \"perceived enhancement\" of cyst wall or septa\n\u00bb  non-enhancing hyperdense intrarenal cysts > 3cm\n\nClass 2F cysts may require 6 month follow-up exams over 24 months.\n\nAll Class 2 and 2F cysts may NOT have \"measurable enhancement\" with contrast and should be generally well marginated.\n\n\u2022  Class 3:\nThe third category includes complex cysts that have irregular, thickened walls and\/or septa.  These cysts may have extensive calcification and will enhance with contrast.  However, these cysts should be relatively homogeneous in density and should not contain solid components.\n\nThese masses need surgical intervention in most cases, because they may be:\n\u00bb MLCN - Multiloculated Cystic Nephroma\n\u00bb Hemorrhagic cysts\n\u00bb Infected cysts\n\n\u2022  Class 4:\nThe fourth and last Bosniak category can include all of the previously stated components - but show definite enhancing soft-tissue regions, appear heterogeneous in density, and have various solid or hypercalcified inclusions - indicating possible necrosis.  In previous studies, this class has always been shown to indicate cancer on follow-up pathological report - and they should be removed. \n \nMany small retrospective studies have shown the Bosniak classification system to be quite useful in making a clinical decision between choosing surgical therapy versus clinical follow-up with serial CT scans. \n\nIts only criticism comes from individuals who feel that the radiologic inter-observer variability is too large and is a major diagnostic concern.\n\neMedicine - http:\/\/www.emedicine.com\/med\/topic3189.htm\n\nCTISUS - http:\/\/www.ctisus.org\/cta_web\/8_05\/Fielding\/AR_08-05_CTA_Fielding.htm\n\nRadiology - http:\/\/radiology.rsnajnls.org\/cgi\/content\/abstract\/231\/2\/365\n\nAJR - http:\/\/www.ajronline.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/181\/5\/1425","External Links":"www.ajronline.org\/cgi\/content\/full\/181\/5\/1425","Keywords":"Bosniakcyst classificationrenal cell carcinoma","Reference":"Warren KS, McFarlane J.

It accounts for 4% of all osteogenic sarcomas. The classic location for a parosteal osteosarcoma is the posterior distal metaphysis of the femur; however, it may also arise in the posterior metaphysis of the proximal tibia and the proximal metaphysis of the humerus, and rarely elsewhere. It is slow-growing but has a tendency to recur after inadequate excision, and it may metastasize. The lesion arises from the outer fibrous layer of periosteum. Common presenting symptoms are aching or limited range of motion due to interference with a joint. \n\nThe tumor merges with the cortex by a stalk early on in the disease process and has a broad base later on in the progression. The bone marrow of the bone does not extend into the base of the tumor. Although, there may be occasional medullary involvement by the tumor.  Radiographically it is a broad-based, juxtacortical, densely ossified mass, the periphery somewhat less dense that the base. CT scan is most useful and can demonstrate a radiolucent zone of periosteum and fibrous tissue trapped between the tumor and cortex.

Myositis ossificans is more densely calcified at its periphery and usually does not involve the adjacent cortex. With an osteochondroma the stalk of an exostosis is contiguous with the cortex of the bone from which it arises and the medullary bone within the stalk is also contiguous with that of the adjacent bone. Chondroid calcification within the cartilaginous cap may be present and is also distinctive.\n\nParosteal osteosarcoma has a relatively good prognosis compared to conventional osteosarcoma.

This is associated with the absence of the ipsilateral kidney.  Class III is a fusion anomaly in which there us 2 separate uterus horns, cervices, and vaginas.  Bicornuate uterus (class IV) is characterized by 2 uterine horns but one cervix and vagina.  It is caused by incomplete resorption of the uterine septum.  However, the septum is composed of myometrium and often doesn't extend the entire length of the uterine cavity.  These features distinguish it from a septate uterus in which there is a fibrous septum. These patients are typically asymptomatic and no treatment is typically necessary.  Most of these women maintain their fertility.  However, there is an association between bicornuate uterus and incompetent cervix.  Class V and VI are septate uterus (high incidence of infertility) and T-shaped uterus (results from diethylstilbestrol exposure inutero), respectively.\n\nHysterosalpingography is often used to evaluate the uterine cavity, while US is the typical screening exam for uterine wall abnormalities.

In the setting of trauma, it can either be direct or indirect. Direct trauma results from a direct blow to the quadriceps muscle, causing it to tear.  An indirect injury is caused by a rapid and severe contraction of the quadriceps while the knee is in flexion. Both of these mechanisms can cause complete or partial tears. Spontaneous injury usually occurs in the elderly and is often associated with chronic diseases (although it can happen in healthy individuals) such as diabetes mellitus, renal failure, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or gout. It has also been associated with corticosteroid therapy.  Most tears will occur at the quadriceps enthesis and distal quadriceps tendon near its insertion side into the patella. Medial and lateral retinacular tears occur when there is valgus or varus angulation while the quadriceps is contracted.\n\nOn physical exam a partial tear can be difficult to discern. The findings will include decreased extension strength that is often only evident only when done against resistance. Complete tears are much easier to observe. Examination will illicit inability to extend the knee, soft tissue hematoma, or a palpable\/visible gap in the soft tissue superior to the patella. Studies that are done to support the physical findings should include radiographs followed by sonography  when patellar subluxation is not present, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). \n\nOn routine radiograph, findings that are associated with a complete tear are soft tissue swelling, inferior positioning of the patella (also known as patella baja), distortion of the soft tissue planes above the patella, and avulsed patellar fragments. If there is no other injury suspected other than the quadriceps tendon rupture and no subluxation of the patella, sonography, sonography is a useful and inexpensive test  to confirm the  radiological findings. However, sonography does not allow an adequate evaluation of the osseous and cartilaginous structures and  other ligaments such as retinacula and collateral ligaments. When other abnormalities are suspected. MRI should be performed after the plain radiographs. On MR images, a complete tear will appear as disruption of the low-signal-intensity tendon with high-signal-intensity hematoma\/ post-traumatic inflammation filling the gap of the torn tendon. MRI also confirms the patella baja. The tear should be evaluated in three planes for its full extent. MRI also demonstrates associated injuries such as medial retinacular tear, with the disruption of the retinaculum usually at its patellar insertion and an infolding of the retinaculum medially and even posterior to the tendon. Hematomas of the soft tissue and patellar avulsions and contusions, and osteochondral trauma can also be shown.\n\nWhen identified, the quadriceps rupture should be treated expeditiously. When the injury is complete as in this case, direct end to end repair is done with immobilization of the knee in extension. The repair shows the best results when done within  two months of the injury. With delay in treatment, proximal migration and scarring of the quadriceps occurs and  surgery  more difficult, sometimes  requiring the quadriceps lengthening procedures, a muscle or tendon transplant or both. \n1.

Typically heparing and warfarin are the agents employed.  Unfractionated heparin acts primarily as an indirect thrombin inhibitor, and to a lesser extent as a factor Xa inhibitor.  It has the advantage of fast activity, but presents difficulty with dosing (requiring intravenous administration) and monitoring of the patient's PTT.  Dosing normally follows a nomogram and varies from institution to institution depending upon laboratory ranges.  The introduction of low molecular weight heparin, a factor Xa inhibitor, as an alternative to unfractionated heparin allows easier administration with standard dosing, subcutaneous administration, and no laboratory monitoring.  Alternatively, warfarin, an inhibitor of vitamin K-dependant coagulation factors, is typically used for long term out patient anticoagulation needs owing to its oral administration.  Warfarin is monitored therapeutically on a weekly basis with the patient's PT and INR (standard INR goal 2.0-3.0).\n\nAs is the case with nearly all medical interventions, anticoagulation does not come without potential side-effects.  The most significant of these centers around hemorrhage.  Patients undergoing anticoagulation are at increased risk for bleeding, both following trauma and sponaneously.  Abdominal wall hematomas represent a real and potentially fatal side effect of therapeutic anticoagulation.  Several cases of abdominal wall hemorrhage have been reported in the literature following the initiation of anticoagulation therapy.

The Salter Harris radiologic classification system of physeal fractures is the most commonly utilized method of describing these fractures.  This system divides fractures into five types depending upon the involvement of the physis, epiphysis, or metaphysis.\n\nType I fractures are transverse through the hypertrophic zone of the physis and results in widening of the physis.  In these injuries, the growing zone of the physis is typically not disturbed and overall growth disturbance is uncommon.\n\nType II fractures traverse the metaphysis and physis, but do not involve the epiphysis.  This represents the most common type of physeal fracture, accounting for up to 75% of injuries.  While these may result in mild limb foreshortening, functional limitations are rare.\n\nType III fractures traverse the physis and the epiphysis, but spare the metaphysis.  These represent a more serious clinical issue, as they tend to involve the articular cartilage and have a greater predisposition for growth arrest.\n\nType IV fractures involve the epiphysis, physis, and metaphysis.  Like the type III injury, these fractures have a greater predisposition for growth arrest.\n\nType V fractures result from a crush injury to all or part of the physis.  Initial diagnosis may be dificult radiographically without specific clinical data.  Often the diagnosis is made in follow up, after partial or complete boney fusion across the physeal plate has ensued.\n\nWhile it has been estimated that nearly 30% of these fractures result in growth plate disturbance, only 2% result in significant functional disability.","External Links":"www.emedicine.com\/radio\/topic613.htm","Keywords":"Salter-HarrisPediatric traumaepiphysis","Reference":"Donnelly, LF.

Unfortunately, this prognosis cannot be offered to those with metastatic disease.  Overall, the median survival is six to nine months, but in the subset of patients with bone metastases, the survival is only four months.  Bone metastasis is usually a late occurrence is the course of the disease.    \n\nEtiology and Pathogenesis:  \nMelanoma can be broadly divided into two categories: sporadic (90 %) and familial (10 %).  As is true with most neoplasms the cause is multifactorial.  A host of environmental and genetic factors combine in synergy to produce unregulated cell proliferation.  In the case of sporadic melanoma, exposure to ultraviolet B (290 to 320 nm) and ultraviolet A (320 to 400 nm) is the most significant environmental factor.  The most influential genetic component of this disease is a deletion or mutation in the p16INK4 gene.  Normally, this protein regulates cell proliferation by inhibiting the assembly of cyclin D\/CDK 4\/6 complex.   This genetic error occurs in 25 to 40 percent of sporadic melanomas. Other risk factors include, in decreasing order: past history of melanoma; family history of melanoma or dysplastic nevus; presence of large congenital nevi; presence of ten or greater dysplastic nevi; presence of 100 or greater common acquired nevi; fair skin; red hair; and high intermittent sun exposure. \n\nMalignant melanoma is the final lesion in a series of premalignant lesions that follow a predictable pattern of progression.  First, a normal melanocyte escapes keratinocyte control and becomes a nevus cell.  Next, the cell separates from the basement membrane and demonstrates cytologic atypia, thus becoming a dysplastic nevus cell.  Subsequently, the cell exhibits a radial growth phase, followed by a vertical growth phase.  The Breslow Depth (0.76 mm) is the most reliable predictor of the behavior of the primary lesion, so that the likelihood of metastatic transformation increases with the depth of vertical growth.  The ability to spread to distant sites is a function of the b3 subunit of the vitronectin receptor.\n\nEpidemiology: \nLancaster is credited with discovering a relationship between melanoma incidence and latitude.  As the distance to the equator decreases, the incidence and rate of melanoma mortality in whites increases.  Interestingly, there are 30 cases per 100,000 people in Australia.  Australia exhibits the highest melanoma incidence in the world because of its equatorial climate, fair-skinned population, and ozone depletion.  In the United States, the incidence has increased from 1 per 100,000 in 1935 to 15 per 100,000 in 1996.  In 1973, the mortality was 1.6 per 100,000 individuals; in 1996, the mortality rate was 2.3 per 100,000 individuals.  At present, melanoma ranks as the sixth most common cancer in American men, and the seventh most common cancer among American women.  The risk for developing melanoma among white Americans is 1 in 85.\n\nClinical Manifestations:\nCutaneous melanoma is distinguished by its asymmetry, diffuse borders, variegated color, diameter greater than 5 mm, and evolving morphology.  Ten percent of lesions ulcerate and bleed.  In a study of 84,000 with melanoma, 2.2% of all melanoma presented without signs of a primary lesion (Chang, Cancer 1998; 83: 1664).  These patients are usually younger than other melanoma patients, and they tend to be male.  The prognosis is similar to that of patients with known primary cutaneous melanoma.  The most common sites for metastasis are skin, lungs, liver, brain, and bone.\t\nBrain metastases are present in 8% to 46% of melanoma patients.\n\nDiagnosis:  \nLymph node core biopsy with subsequent immunohistochemical analysis provides a definitive diagnosis.  Ninety percent of melanomas are positive for S-100 antigen.  HMB-45 (Melanoma Associated Marker) is more specific for melanoma than S-100, but it is less sensitive.  Melanoma cells do not exhibit cytokeratin, leukocyte common antigen, or desmin.  \n\nTreatment:\nAt present, there is no cure for disseminated melanoma (Stage IV: M1).   Because brain metastases cause symptoms via compression of neural parenchyma, all therapy is geared toward reducing intracranial pressure.  This can be achieved via corticosteroids, gamma knife irradiation or conventional surgery (in the case of a solitary brain lesion), and\/or whole brain radiotherapy (in the case of multiple lesions).  The pain associated with bone metastases is successfully treated by radiotherapy.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"melanomaHMB-45vitronectin receptor b3 subunit","Reference":"1.

The preductal location limits the blood volume load needed for normal aortic development.\n\nPostductal coarctation is more common than the preductal form and often is not symptomatic in the neonatal period.\n\nTypically, there is dilatation of the descending aorta distal to the coarctation with collateralization of vessels into the aorta primarilly via the intercostal arteries (2). This finding can result in rib notching. An abberant right subclavian artery that originates distal to the coarctation can serve as a major collateral to the right and rib notching occurs only on the left. If the left subclavian artery arises distal to the coarctation, then the rib notching is unilateral on the right (3).\n\n\nBalloon Angioplasty - http:\/\/www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov\/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1767490","External Links":null,"Keywords":"coarctationrib notchingpseudocoarctation","Reference":"1.

These microaneurysms, predispose the patient to spontaneous ICH.  Bleeding is limited by the resistance of tissue pressure in the surrounding brain structures.  If the hematoma is large, distortion of structures and increased ICP may cause headache, vomiting, and decreased alertness. ICH accounts for 10 to 15 percent of all strokes in whites and about 30 percent in blacks and individuals of Asian origin.\n\nLocations of hypertensive ICHs are putamen (40%), lobar (22%), thalamus (15%), pons (8%), cerebellum (8%), and caudate (7%).\n\nThe differential diagnosis should include hypertension, bleeding diatheses (especially as a result of iatrogenic coumadin), trauma (subdural and epidural hematomas), and amyloid angiopathy as the most frequent causes.  Rarely, brain tumors and abscesses can have a rapid onset mimicking ICH.\n\nIn young, normotensive patients, especially those with lobar and intraventricular hemorrhages, vascular malformations (AVM) are the most likely source of bleeding.  \n\nSome primary and metastatic brain tumors, especially renal carcinoma and choriocarcinoma, can develop hemorrhages within the tumor.  The initial evaluation, should include CBC, chemistries, coagulation studies (PT, PTT, bleeding time, and platelet count), arterial blood gas analysis, and toxicology screen.\n\nCT scan should be performed immediately in patients suspected of having an ICH.  Follow-up CT should be performed to evaluate a change in clinical signs or mental status.\n\nPatients who have ICH after cocaine use have a high likelihood of vascular malformations and aneurysms and need angiography.Medical management involves reduction and maintenance of intracranial pressure.  Commonly, patients are intubated if they are unable to protect their airway.  Blood pressure swings may be controlled with IV labetolol (adequate intracranial perfusion pressure must be maintained).  As an adjunct, patients may be placed in the reverse-Trendelenberg position to assist in relieving increased intracranial pressure.\n\nRecent studies of hematoma removal have shown promise for open surgical decompression, but only if accomplished early after the onset of symptoms.  The best candidates for surgery may be patients with moderate to large hematomas who are still awake.  Neuroimaging techniques have made it possible to drain hematomas percutaneously, using stereotactic surgery. Survival depends on the location, size, and rapidity of development of the hematoma.  ICHs are at first soft and dissect along white matter fiber tracts.\n\nIf the patient survives the initial changes in ICP, blood is absorbed and a cavity or slit forms that may interrupt brain pathways.  Patients with small hematomas located deep and near midline structures often develop secondary herniation and mass effect, and these patients have a high mortality rate.  Survivors invariably have severe neurological deficits.  In patients with medium-sized hematomas, the deficit varies with the location and size of the hematomas.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Intracerebralhemorrhage","Reference":"1.\tGoetz CG, and Pappert EJ.

Chorea-ballismus with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus.\nAJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 1996 Jun-Jul;17(6):1057-64.\n\nAbstract\nPURPOSE: To describe the neuroimaging (Ct, MR, and single-photon emission CT [SPECT]) findings in a series of patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus and to correlate the imaging findings with the clinical presentation.\n\nMETHODS: The neuroimaging and clinical data from 10 patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus were evaluated. Family and drug histories, as well as other causes of chorea, were excluded. All 10 patients had CT, 5 also had MR imaging, and 3 had SPECT examinations. Three had follow-up CT and MR imaging studies, and MR findings were correlated with CT findings in 5 cases. Two experienced neuroradiologists, aware of the diagnosis but blinded to the clinical status of the patients, evaluated all images and reached a consensus as to the final\ninterpretation.\n\nRESULTS: CT studies in 9 of 10 patients showed a hyperdense putamen and\/or caudate nucleus; in 1, the CT findings were normal. T1-weighted MR images in all 5 patients who had MR imaging (including the patient with a normal CT study) showed hyperintense lesions without significant T2 signal alternation at the basal ganglia. In all 3 of the patients who had SPECT studies of the brain, the scans revealed hypoperfusion at corresponding areas. All 3 follow-up studies depicted resolution of the lesions in the abnormal basal ganglia. Increased hypointensity on T2-weighted and gradient-echo T2*-weighted images was also\nobserved in the sequential MR images. In all patients, the initial side of involvement correlated well with the neuroimaging findings. The chorea resolved within 2 days after treatment of the hyperglycemia in 9 patients.\n\nCONCLUSION: In patients with chorea-ballismus associated with nonketotic hyperglycemia in primary diabetes mellitus, CT and T1-weighted MR images show unilateral or bilateral lesions of the putamen and\/or caudate. SPECT scans show hypoperfusion. These findings may be related to petechial hemorrhage and\/or myelin destruction. Early recognition of these imaging characteristics may facilitate diagnosis of primary diabetes mellitus with hyperglycemia and prompt appropriate therapy.\n\nPMID: 8791916","External Links":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed?term=nonketotic%20hyperglycemia%20stroke&itool=QuerySuggestion","Keywords":"diabetes basal ganglia (putamen)hemiballismus hemichoreaCT hyperdense, T1W hyperintense T2W hypointense","Reference":null,"Title":"Nonketotic hyperglycemic hemichorea hemiballismus"}}

Approximately 40% of cases of medullary nephrocalcicosis are attributable to primary hyperparathyroidism, another 20% to renal tubular acidosis, and the remaining 40% divided among many other causes.  Most of the conditions that cause nephrocalcinosis can also result in nephrolithiasis.  Their coexistence helps establish the etiology and may significantly impact patient management.  The appearance of medullary nephrocalcinosis equates to calcifications involving the distal convoluted tubules in the loops of Henle.\n    \nHYPERCALCIURIA, in general, is due to to dissolution of the bone, excessive ingestion or absorption of calcium from the gastrointestinal tract, or faulty renal reabsorption of calcium.  Hyperparathyroidism is the most common single cause.  Medullary nephrocalcicosis is seen in 5% of those with primary hyperparathyroidism (parathyroid adenoma), and nephrolithiasis is seen in 50-80% of these patients.  Secondary hyperparathyroidism (usually due to renal disease) is a much less likely cause.\n\nRENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS is characterized by abnormal renal tubular function that results in chronic systemic acidosis and a persistent alkali urine.  There are two types of RTA.  Type II RTA consists of proximal abnormalities, in which there is a greater than normal loss of bicarbonate, and renal calculi are not formed.  Distal tubular dysfunction (type I RTA) interferes with hydrogen ion transfer into the urine, and may result in stone formation. 30% of infants and 70% of adults with type I RTA develop medullary nephrocalcicosis or nephrolithiasis.  RTA may cause delayed skeletal maturation and osteomalacia.  Primary RTA results from an inherited enzymatic defect.  Diseases known to cause secondary RTA include Wilson\u2019s disease, Fanconi\u2019s syndrome, hyperglobinemias, nephrotoxic drugs (outdated tetracycline, amphotericine B), and acetazolamide administration.  These processes (primary or secondary causes of RTA) result in an inability to acidify urine.  Since calcium ions are much more soluble in acidic urine crystalline calcium salts precipitate.\n\nRENAL TUBULAR ECTASIA, or medullary sponge kidney, is a disease in which the terminal nephrons and ducts of Bellini are dilated.  Calculi form in about half the cases owing to stasis of urine in these dilated ducts.

If adequate trials of physical therapy fail, indicated by continued anterior instability and pain, or if multiple dislocations occur, more invasive procedures are performed.  Various surgical procedures have been developed for treatment of recurrent anterior dislocations of the humeral head.  Treatment can be either by arthroscopy or open anterior shoulder repair (axillary approach or the Bankart lesion fixation procedure); other procedures include the Bristow Helfet procedure, Magnuson Stack procedure, Eden Hybinette procedure, Oudard procedure and Trillat procedure.  The Bankart procedure is the gold standard, with success rates of 90-95%.  In associated Hill-Sachs lesions, the glenoid can be augmented with a tricortical iliac crest graft.Traditionally, arthroscopic techniques have had a failure rate of about 20% at 3.5 years, whereas the newer Bankart fixation techniques have brought this down to 10% or less.  Support is gathering for earlier surgical intervention in patients with recurrent dislocations."},"Topic":{"ACR Code":"4.4","Category":"Trauma","Disease Discussion":"Anterior dislocations are produced by complex forces acting on the humerus, including abduction and external rotation.  The Hill-Sachs fracture results from this anterior dislocation (97% vs. 3%) with compression of posterolateral aspect of the humeral head by the inferior glenoid labrum. Hill-Sachs deformities occur in 35-40% of anterior dislocations and up to 80 % of recurrent dislocations. Hill-Sachs fractures can occur with subluxations, or single or multiple dislocations.  The dislocation may also cause a Bankart fracture at the impact site on the glenoid.  This is a fracture of the anterior aspect of the inferior rim of the glenoid caused by the anterior movement of the humeral head and is best seen on the anteroposterior projection with the arm in the neutral position.  If radiographs at presentation show no dislocation, the presence of either Hill-Sachs deformities or Bankart\u2019s fractures are indicative of a prior dislocation. MRI is the best imaging modality for identifying cartilaginous and osseous Hill-Sachs deformities and associated tears of the anterior glenoid labrum.  The contour defect of both cartilage and bone at the superior aspect of the humeral head posterolaterally represents the Hill-Sachs deformity and the high signal intensity separating the cartilaginous labrum from the bony labrum represents the tear \u2013 the Bankart lesion.\nThe younger the patient when the first dislocation occurs, the greater is the probability that dislocation will recur.   Thus, patients 20 years old or younger have a 80-90% chance of lifetime recurrence, those 30 or younger have a 60% recurrence rate, and of those 40 and older at time of first dislocation, have a 10-15% probability of recurrence.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Hill-SachsBankartshoulder dislocation","Reference":"Stoller, David W.

On CT bone erosion as well as complete or partial opacification of the affected sinus is seen. CT angiography may reveal vessel involvement (dissection, narrowing, occlusion). Variable signal is seen on T1 and T2.  On post contrast imaging enhancement of the involved tissues is seen.\n\n-Allergic Fungal Sinusitis: On CT, allergic fungal sinusitis typically shows high density material within the sinuses.  On MRI there is low T1 and T2 weighted signal in the sinuses. The peripheral inflamed mucosa will enhance on post contrast imaging.\n\n-Mycetoma: In patients who are otherwise healthy, occasionally a mycetoma may develop. This sometimes occurs afer the chang in the local sinus microenvironment, as can be seen after sinus surgery or radiation therapy. This involves one sinonasal cavity, and on CT is seen as a focal mass within the sinus lumen.  It typically has areas of high density and may have calcification.  The adjacent bone is thick and sclerotic as a result of chronic inflammation. After the administration of contrast, the inflamed mucosa at the periphery of the sinus may enhance.  On MRI, a low signal mass on both T1 and T2 is seen within the sinus.  Occasionally, on T2 the signal may be so low as to be mistaken for air.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: \n-Mycetoma: Surgical excision curative\n-Invasive Fungal Sinusitis: Radical debridment, IV amphotericin B, with use of itraconazole as long-term suppressive treatment.  Acute fungal sinusitis is life-threatening and can be lethal within a matter of hours.  \n-Allergic Fungal Sinusitis: May be treated with topical and systemic antifungal agents along with topical steroids and saline irrigation.

At approximately 7 weeks gestation, the two anlages fuse, and in over 90% of individuals their ducts fuse. The normal anatomy is the duct draining the dorsal anlage joins the duct draining the ventral anlage to enter the major ampulla; thus the major route of pancreatic drainage is established through the duct of Wirsung at the major ampulla. In 5-7% of individuals, there is failure of fusion of the dorsal and ventral anlage, resulting in pancreatic divisum.

Blood flows preferentially through the AVM therefore depriving other areas of the brain of blood flow.  This steal phenomenon can produce neurological symptoms, seizures, and parenchymal loss.  This increase in blood flow also can produce aneurysms.  The location of the AVMs is 80-85% in the cerebral hemispheres and 10-15% in the posterior fossa.\n\nClinical Presentation:\nArteriovenous malformations are usually congenital developmental anomalies, but are frequently asymptomatic until 30 to 40 years of age.  Approximately 25% of these patients hemorrhage by age 15 and 80-90% of the patients are symptomatic by age 50.  Symptoms include seizure and headaches.\n\nPathology:\nArteriovenous malformations consist of feeding arteries that are dilated with a cluster of entangled vascular loops.  Blood flows preferentially through the AVM therefore depriving other areas of the brain of blood flow.  This steal phenomenon can produce neurological symptoms, seizures, and parenchymal loss.  This increase in blood flow also can produce aneurysms.  The location of the AVMs is 80-85% in the cerebral hemispheres and 10-15% in the posterior fossa.  \n\nImage Findings:\nCT scans typically show tangled vessels in the parenchyma that are high density contrast.  These vessels are noted to have a serpentine configuration.  Curvilinear or speckled calcification may also be present.  MR scans show curvilinear flow voids secondary to fast flow seen on pulse sequences and dilated feeding arteries.  The appearance of the arteries vary due to flow rate, direction, pulse sequence, and the presence and age of the hemorrhage.  Gliosis and hemorrhages also appear on the MR images.  Often MRA images are used to diagnose the disease.  MR is more sensitive to the feeding arteries, the core or nidus, and the enlarged draining veins.\n\nDifferential Diagnosis:\nDifferential diagnosis includes vascular malformations.  If normal blood flow is present, capillary telangiectasis and developmental venous anomalies are commonly confused with AVM.  Capillary telangiectasis are lesions measuring approximately 3 cm in diameter and are typically found in the pons.  The majority of the lesions do not hemorrhage and are observed as nodular enhancements after contrast on T1WI.  Developmental venous anomalies are the most common cerebral vascular malformation.  These malformations rarely hemorrhage.  If hemorrhage is noted, it is most likely due to a coexisting cavernous angioma.  If the malformation is isolated, they appear to be composed of dilated medullary veins that form a large channel draining into cortical veins or subependymal veins.  If there is high blood flow, AV fistula shares similar characteristics with AVM.  AV fistula is an arterial dissection or laceration that spontaneously communicates with an adjacent vein or dural sinus.  These fistulas are commonly seen in the cavernous sinus, below the petrous temporal bone, and foramen magnum.\n\nTreatment:\nDepending on the size and location of the AVM, the treatment may include embolization, surgery, or radiation therapy.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":null,"Title":"Arteriovenous Malformation"}}

It occurs in both sexes with equal frequency and usually after the age of 40 years. It is found most often in the extremities. Pain is a late symptom related to the increasing mass size. Often the tumor grows slowly, but an occasional anaplastic tumor may grow rapidly. Physical examination reveals a mass with boundaries that may be ill defined. (Canale: Campbell's Operative Orthopaedics, 10th ed., Mosby, Inc 2003.).      On radiographs, the presence of radiolucent fat in liposarcomas suggests a more differentiated form whereas soft tissue density is more consistent with more aggressive forms. (Reznick: Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disorders, 4th ed. W.B. Saunders Co. 2002). On T1-weighted MR images, differentiatied liposarcomas show extensive areas of high signal intensity consistent with their fat content. Areas of low signal intensity and septae in lipomatous tumors suggest more aggressive lesions.  On T2-weighted MR images with fat saturation, less differentiated liposarcomas show areas of high signal intensity whereas the differentiated fat is low signal intensity. Contrast-enhanced MRI shows enhancement of the more malignant regions of the liposarcoma.  At MRI, the myxoid areas of myxoid liposarcoma characteristically show high signal intensity areas on T2-weighted images that do not enhance after contrast. (Shapeero: Dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging for soft tissue sarcomas. in Seminars in Musculoskeletal Radiology, Vol.3 No.2, 1999)     At gross pathology, liposarcomas are large and lobulated and many are encapsulated.  At histology, liposarcomas are divided into  well-differentiated, myxoid, round cell, pleomorphic and dedifferentiated subtypes varying from the low-grade malignant type (well-differentiated)  to myoid subtype of intermediate grade and the pleomorphic, round cell, and dedifferentiated of higher grades.

Gout prevalence increases in direct association with age; the increased longevity of populations in industrialized nations may contribute to a higher prevalence of gout through the disorder's association with aging-related diseases such as metabolic syndrome and hypertension, and treatments for these diseases such as thiazide diuretics for hypertension. Modifiable risk factors for gout include obesity, the use of certain medications, high purine intake, and consumption of purine-rich alcoholic beverages.\n\nCommon  Locations: acute gout is most often seen in the great toe; more rarely in the heel, ankle or instep. Tophi are chalky deposits of sodium urate that are large enough to be seen on radiographs and may occur at virtually any site. The most common sites include the joints of the hands or feet.\n\nRadiology: MR imaging is not routinely used for evaluation of tophaceous gout. However, gout may present clinically in an atypical or confusing manner. A gouty tophus occasionally mimics an infectious or neoplastic process and MR imaging may be helpful under these circumstances. On magnetic resonance imaging, tophi usually have low signal intensity on both TI- and T2-weighted images and a variable enhancement pattern.\n\nPrognosis  and  Treatment: Gout affects everyone differently. Some people have one episode and never have further progression of disease. Others have several episodes along with chronic pain and progressive joint damage. There is no cure for gout, but it can be controlled with medication.

This tumor makes up about one-third of childhood posterior fossa tumors, typically presenting  late  in  the  first decade  or  in  the  early second decade.

It may be predominantly cystic with a mural nodule (as shown in a  different patient,  Film .4), multicystic, or predominantly solid (diffuse) on CT or MR.  Recognizable cysts occur in up to 80%.   Histologically, most  are juvenile  pilocytic astrocytomas similar to those of the third ventricle region.   Diffuse  infiltrating  fibrillary  types occur  in  up  to  15%  of cerebellar astrocytomas and  have  a less favorable prognosis.    Frank   malignancy,   leptomeningeal seeding, and spontaneous hemorrhage are distinctly unusual.\n\nRadiographically,  cerebellar  astrocytoma  arises  within  the cerebellar hemisphere and less  often  in the  vermis,  and  displaces the fourth ventricle without invading it.  On CT, 10-25% contain foci of calcification.  The mass is hypointense on T1-weighted  and  hyperintense on  T2-weighted MR, with one or more cystic components.  After contrast administration, the  mural  nodule  and\/or  solid  components enhance, rendering nonenhancing cysts more conspicuous.\n\nIn  children, vermian or diffuse astrocytoma or those involving the fourth ventricle may mimic medulloblastoma or ependymoma.  In older    adolescents    or    adults,   hemangioblastoma   may   present as a cystic mass indistinguishable from cerebellar astrocytoma.

The dissection can result with stenosis, occlusion, aneurysmal dilation, intraluminal thrombus formation, or extravascular hemorrhage.\n\nRadiographic evaluation for vertebral artery dissection can be complicated by false negatives and false positives. The most common radiographic techniques used for evaluation include CT and MR. Common causes of false positives include turbulent flow simulating stenosis or adjacent structures that mimic hematoma, or patient body habitus. False negatives are often related to lack of inclusion of the affected area in the study field. Often times, evaluation of headache which may be secondary to dissection results in imaging of the head without inclusion of the neck, although the majority of vertebral dissections occur in the cervical neck. \n\nTreatment for vertebral artery dissection often involves antiplatelet or anticoagulation therapy. The highest risk of ischemia secondary to dissection is in the first several days after the dissection occurs.

SDHs are to be anticipated along these structures since there is a continuation of the potential subdural space along these dural reflections.  Interhemispheric fissure and tentorial leaf SDHs are commonly seen in elderly trauma victims, especially if they are alcoholic.  The enlarged subarachnoid spaces of these patients may contribute to an excessive mobility of the brain and greater susceptibility of the interhemispheric\/tentorial veins to traumatic injury.  \n\nAcute subdural hematomas can be classified as \"simple\" or \"complicated,\" depending on whether parenchymal brain injuries (contusions, intracerebral hematomas, diffuse axonal injury) are also present.  Notably, intra-axial injuries are much more common with acute SDHs than with either EDHs or chronic SDHs.  The majority of patients with acute SDHs, in fact, will have associated parenchymal brain injuries.  Secondary forms of brain injury (anoxic\/ischemic injury, trans-tentorial\/subfalcine\/tonsilar herniation, increased intracranial pressure) are also quite common in patients with acute SDHs. \n\nAcute SDHs still carry a significant risk of morbidity and mortality.  The overall mortality of patients with acute SDHs is greater than that for any other traumatic intracranial mass lesion (ICH, EDH, focal contusion).  Despite modern therapy, the mortality is over 35% in all large series and greater than 50% in most reports.  A primary factor related to clinical outcome of patients with acute SDHs is the presence or absence of associated intraaxial lesions.  In one series of patients, the mortality of \"simple\" SDHs was 22% as compared to over 50% for those with \"complicated\" SDHs.  A second major factor significantly related to outcome is the presence and severity of mass effect.  Mass effect from a SDH may be due to a combination of factors; the hematoma itself, underlying parenchymal injury, intracerebral hematoma, and diffuse cerebral edema\/swelling from a loss of vasomotor autoregulation.  The mass effect can produce injury to the brain through a generalized increase in intracranial pressure, global or localized impairment of blood flow, transtentorial\/tonsilar herniation resulting in ischemic\/pressure necrosis of the upper brain stem.  Other factors directly related to a poor outcome are; greater age of the patient, low Glasgow Coma Scores at the time of operation, bilateral lesions, rapid rate of SDH accumulation, and delayed surgical evacuation (> 4 hours) of the SDH.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":null,"Title":"1.

However, a child can sometime present with an NOF as the etiology for a primary complaint when the NOF causes noticeable deformity or pain.  Rarely, an NOF presents as pathologic fracture, usually when the lesion occupies more than 50% of the bone diameter.  NOFs of all presentations may increase or decrease in size before spontaneously resolving.\n\nDx: The diagnosis of NOF is usually made as an incidental finding on a radiograph obtained for other reasons.

They arise from ependymal cells lining the central canal or its remnants and from the cells in the filum terminale.  Of these tumors, there are two subsets: intramedullary ependymomas (cellular ependymomas), and ependymomas occurring nearly exclusively in the conus medullaris and filum terminale (myxopapillary ependymomas).  \nMyxopapillary ependymomas represent 10-15% of all ependymomas, and account for 90% of the primary tumors in the filum terminale and cauda equina.  These tumors are fleshy, sausage-shaped, reddish to purple in color and moderately vascular on gross examination.  Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to grow slowly and to large sizes (often spanning 2-4 vertebral segments), often expanding adjacent bone of the lumbosacral canal and neural foramina.  They commonly hemorrhage which can lead to nonaneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and superficial siderosis, as well as complex internal signal characteristics and calcification.  \nComputed tomography of myxopapillary ependymomas typically demonstrates an isodense intradural mass, with possible bony expansion, and strong, uniform contrast enhancement.  Magnetic resonance imaging of these tumors demonstrates an intradural mass that is typically isointense to the spinal cord on T1-weighted images, hyperintense to the spinal cord on T2-weighted sequences, and demonstrated strong homogenous enhancement following contrast administration.  Myxopapillary ependymomas with a hemorrhagic component may demonstrate heterogeneity on T1-weighted sequences, and a low signal-intensity hemosiderin rim on T2-weighted sequences.\nClinically myxopapillary ependymomas most often present with low back, leg or sacral pain.  Leg weakness and sphincter dysfunction are only seen in 20-25% of patients.  Due to their indolent growth, delay in diagnosis is common with these tumors, with an average of 2.4 years of symptoms before a correct diagnosis is established.  Myxopapillary ependymomas tend to occur in males more often than females (2:1), with a peak age of diagnosis within the 3rd to 4th decades of life.   Complete surgical resection is generally curative, although local recurrence is possible if resection is incomplete.  Adjuvant radiation therapy is used for multifocal lesions.  Certain aggressive sacral and presacral tumors may spread locally to lymph nodes and rarely to distant sites (e.g. lungs and bone).","External Links":null,"Keywords":"EpendymomaFilum terminale massAstorcytoma","Reference":"Wiestler OD et al: Myxopapillary ependymoma.

IPMN is classified into three types: branch pancreatic duct type, main pancreatic duct type, and combined type.  Combined type is the most common.\n\nIPMN presents clinically with diarrhea, pain, weight loss, acute pancreatitis and diabetes.  Typical age of onset is 60-80 y\/o, more commonly in males.\n\nCT findings for branch pancreatic duct type include a thin, irregular and peripheral lobulated multicystic lesion (\u201cgrape-like\u201d clusters).The main pancreatic duct type appears as a markedly dilated and tortuous main pancreatic duct.  Polypoid lesions may be seen lining the main duct.  The combined type appears as a multicystic lesion (commonly within the uncinate process) which is contiguous with a markedly dilated and tortuous main pancreatic duct. MRCP will show communication between the dilated duct and cystic lesions.\n\nThe differential diagnosis for IPMN includes chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic pseudocyst, mucinous cystic neoplasm and serous cystadenoma.  This patient had no history of pancreatitis.  \n\nImaging features of IPMN with invasive carcinoma may include mural nodularity or solid mass measuring 3-10 mm, diffuse or multifocal main duct involvement, main or combined duct types, main pancreatic duct measuring > 10-15 mm, branch duct type measuring > 3 cm or mural nodularity, common bile duct > 15 mm, or evidence of metastases.  Generally, main duct and combined duct types are resected in good surgical candidates.  Branch duct type IPMN without suggestion of invasive carcinoma may be monitored.  Although all IPMNs are felt to have malignant potential.\n\nReferences:\n\nLim JH, et al. Radiologic spectrum of intraductal papillary mucinous tumor of the pancreas.

The differential considerations for a splenic cyst include post-traumatic, epidermoid cyst, abscess, hydatid cyst, infarction, splenic peliosis, and neoplasia, both benign and malignant.  80% of cases in North America are post-traumatic.  Direct surgical intervention in this case yielded a diagnosis of epidermoid cyst, as defined by the presence of an inner endothelial lining.\n\nSplenic cysts can remain stable in size for many years, or enlarge slowly, occasionally to massive proportion (as was the case with this patient).  The potential for rupture and hemorrhage increases with increasing size.  There is also a risk for secondary infection.  Optimal surgical management is not clearly defined, but a number of procedures are available for symptomatic or enlarging cysts.  Available options for those with non-parasitic cysts include percutaneous procedures (eg, biopsy, aspiration, drainage), or more direct surgical interventions such as decapsulation\/cyst wall unroofing, partial or total splenectomy.  However, only splenectomy provides diagnostic certainty, which is rarely clinically justified.   \n\nReferences:\n\nUrrutia M, Mergo PJ, Ros LH, et al.

Sir Thomas Hodgkin was the first to describe Hodgkin\u2019s disease in 1932.  Hodgkin\u2019s can present at any age, but it is more prevalent among adolescents and young adults.  It typically presents as painless, rubbery lymphadenopathy involving the superficial lymph node groups.  Cervical nodes are involved nearly 70% of the time.  Approximately half of patients also have splenomegaly.  Mediastinal involvement occurs in approximately 10% of patients, and mediastinal involvement is characteristic of the Nodular Sclerosing type (as in this patient).  Cutaneous involvement can occur and is usually a late complication.  Patients may also present with constitutional symptoms (night sweats, pruritis, fatigue, weight loss, etc) with widespread disease.  \nThe diagnosis of Hodgkin\u2019s disease is made by lymph node biopsy (as was done in this patient).  There are 4 histological types:\n1.\tNodular Sclerosing (>50%, most common; worst prognosis)\n2.\tMixed cellularity (25%)\n3.\tLymphocyte predominant (5%; best prognosis)\n4.\tLymphocyte depleted (5%)\nStaging of Hodgkin\u2019s disease is made by the use of CXR, BM biopsy, and CT imaging.  There are 4 stages:\n1.\tStage I\u2014confined to one lymph node group (90% 5-yr survival rate)\n2.\tStage II\u2014confined to 2 or more lymph node groups on one side of the diaphragm\n3.\tStage III\u2014involving nodes on both sides of the diaphragm\n4.\tStage IV\u2014Extra-nodal disease (60% 5-yr survival rate) \nTreatment involves radiation therapy and\/or chemotherapy.

Noncontrast CT scan rules out hemorrhagic stroke immediately, but CT has poor sensitivity for demonstrating acute ischemic strokes.  However, more advanced neuroimaging, to include MRI with diffusion weighting has been used to better identify acute infarct.  Additionally, CT and MR perfusion imaging are able to detect early hemodynamic changes associated with ischemia and infarction.  Perfusion imaging can be useful to differentiate between potential salvageable ischemic tissue and tissue infarction.  This has many treatment implications, to include identification of patients amenable to catheter-directed therapies such as intraarterial thrombolysis and mechanical thrombectomy, even if the patient is outside the accepted 3-hour time window for IV thrombolysis.\n     Measurements for brain perfusion include mean transit time (MTT), cerebral blood volume (CBV), and cerebral blood flow (CBF).  For CT Perfusion, a tissue-at-risk map can be generated from these perfusion maps based on minimum threshold values for CBV and CBF to maintain brain viability.  Regions of increased MTT and mildly decreased CBF represent the penumbra and therefore are at risk for infarction.  Due to autoregulation and collateralization, CBV is usually last to be affected by ischemic events and the CBV is maintained as normal or slightly increased.  However, infarction is characterized by increased MTT coupled with significantly decreased CBF and CBV.  Identifying the penumbra is important as this area is potentially salvageable with prompt therapeutic intervention.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"CT cerebral perfusion","Reference":null,"Title":"Acute ischemic stroke, CT perfusion imaging"}}

Previously obtained sputum cultures were significant for Acinetobacter baumannii sensitive only to imipenem\/cilastatin."},"Topic":{"ACR Code":"6.2","Category":"Infection, generalized","Disease Discussion":"A parapneumonic effusion is any pleural effusion associated with suppurative parenchymal lung disease. Simple parapneumonic effusions are uninfected, free-flowing fluid collections. Complicated parapneumonic effusions are early infected fluid collections prone to develop loculations by fibrinous septations. Empyema is a collection of frank pus within the pleural space. An effusion is termed complex when it develops loculations. The natural evolution of untreated simple and complicated parapneumonic effusions is to become complex and to progress to frank empyema with development of a residual cavity or entrapment of the lung by a fibrous peel or cortex.\n\nPneumonia results in parapneumonic effusion in approximately 45% of cases, although less than 5% of these progress to an empyema. Other common causes include mediastinal or pulmonary surgery and trauma. Less frequently, empyema may result from spread of infection from adjacent structures. Mortality from empyema ranges from 1% to 20%. \n\nClinical manifestations vary, depending on the underlying pulmonary process, the responsible organism, the quantity of bacteria and fluid in the pleural space, the stage of the disease, and the host defense mechanisms. The clinical presentation can range from an absence of symptoms to a severe febrile illness with toxemia and shock. In general, it is difficult to distinguish patients with infected pleural effusions from those with sterile parapneumonic effusions on the basis of history and physical examination alone. Clinical manifestations include fever, dyspnea, chest pain, and cough with mucopurulent sputum. Physical examination often reveals decreased breath sounds, dull percussion, and restricted respiratory excursions. \n\nWith the introduction of antibiotics in the mid-1940s, a significant shift occurred in the microbiology of pleural space infections. Anaerobic organisms are now the most common bacteria isolated from infected pleural effusions, being identified in up to 75% of cases, either alone (35%) or in combination with aerobic organisms (40%). Up to 35% of established empyemas have negative Gram stain evaluations and many patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions have negative culture results. Staphylococcus aureus is a relatively common cause of empyema in otherwise healthy adults, children and in patients who have had chest trauma or prior surgery, whereas alcoholic males are particularly susceptible to infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae. \n\nThoracentesis plays a critical role in the management of pleural effusions and in 90% of adult cases yields useful information. Fluid is removed and samples obtained for measurement of pH, glucose, LDH, protein, and differential cell count. An exudate is defined by: (1) a ratio of pleural fluid to serum protein greater than 0.5, (2) a ratio of pleural fluid LDH to serum LDH greater than 0.6, or (3) a pleural fluid LDH more than two-thirds of the upper normal limit for serum or >200 IU [3] . A transudate does not meet any of the above three criteria. \n\nIf the patient has a transudative effusion, no further laboratory tests on the pleural fluid are indicated. If the patient has an exudative pleural effusion, the remaining pleural fluid is sent for WBC and differential, cytologic examination, Gram's stain and cultures for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacteria and fungi if clinically indicated. The aspiration of frank pus confirms the presence of empyema and establishes an absolute indication for urgent drainage of the pleural space. In this instance, Gram's stain and culture are the only laboratory studies necessary to guide initial therapy. Pleural fluid Gram's stains can identify pathogens in 55% to 65% of patients with established empyemas. \nThe posterior-anterior and lateral chest radiographs are the best initial diagnostic modalities. When the patient is upright, free pleural fluid first accumulates in the lowest part of the hemithorax\u2014the posterior costophrenic angles. Lateral decubitus views allow detection of 50 to 100 ml of fluid and the presence of loculations if the fluid fails to layer out along the dependent chest. In the view with the involved side superior, the free fluid layers against the mediastinum and one can assess how much of the radiodensity is due to the fluid and how much is due to a parenchymal infiltrate. In the view with the involved side dependent, the amount of free pleural fluid can be semi-quantitated by measuring the distance from the chest wall to the outside of the lung. If the thickness of fluid exceeds 10 mm, a diagnostic thoracentesis is indicated. However, it is not necessary to tap all parapneumonic effusions, especially if the volume of fluid remains small, the patient is doing well, the fluid moves freely, or serial roentgenograms show improvement. \n\nCT is of great value in the overall evaluation of parapneumonic effusions and should be done early in the assessment of patients with complex parapneumonic effusion or empyema. CT is helpful in (1) differentiating pleural fluid from peripheral parenchymal infiltrates or pleural thickening, (2) evaluating the parenchymal disease, (3) determining the presence of loculations, (4) characterizing the pleural surfaces, and (5) guiding and assessing therapy. Complicated effusions and empyemas are frequently associated with nearby pulmonary consolidation and can be mistaken for a lung abscess. A lung abscess usually presents as a poorly defined, roughly spherical mass surrounded by consolidated but non compressed lung. An empyema is usually elongated, conforms to the shape of the chest wall, and compresses the adjacent lung. Its wall is thin and uniform and the interface angle with the chest wall is obtuse. The margins of the empyema cavity are composed of inflamed visceral and parietal pleura that enhance after administration of intravenous contrast. The visceral and parietal layers are separated by the interposed empyema fluid, giving rise to the \u201csplit pleura sign\u201d.\n\nUS is widely available, provides guidance for thoracentesis or pleural catheter placement, and can be transported to the bedside. US is particularly useful for sampling fluid that does not layer freely on decubitus films, and can distinguish solid from liquid pleural abnormalities better than chest roentgenography. The presence of discrete pleural septations has prognostic importance because loculated collections require drainage for their resolution. Computed tomography, however, gives additional information not obtained by US.\n\nThe sine qua non of empyema management is early, adequate, and dependent drainage. The therapeutic armamentarium for parapneumonic effusion or empyema consists of antibiotic therapy, thoracentesis, chest tube drainage, image-guided percutaneous catheter drainage, intrapleural fibrinolytic agents, and a variety of surgical drainage procedures, including video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) and open thoracotomy.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"empyemaeffusionthoracentesis","Reference":"DeHoyos A, Sundaresan S.

Common symptoms include dyspnea, jugular venous distention, and edema of the face and upper extremities. The most common cause is malignancy. In cases of SVC syndrome secondary to malignancy, 90% are caused by either bronchogenic carcinoma or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Around 2-4% of all lung cancer patients will develop SVC syndrome at some point during their disease course. While Hodgkin's lymphoma is known for mediastinal lymphadenopathy, it rarely causes SVC syndrome.\n\nThere are multiple other non-malignant etiologies. Patients with indwelling intravascular catheters can develop thrombosis resulting in obstruction of the vessel. Fibrosing mediastinitis can result in an excessive fibrotic reaction in the mediastinum that can affect multiple structures within this compartment, to include the SVC. Excessive radiation can cause a similar response, with fibrosis of the vessels resulting in SVC syndrome. \n\nThe severity of symptoms can vary based on the rate of occlusion. A rapid SVC occlusion may not allow enough time for systemic compensation with collateral vein formation, thus increasing the severity of symptoms. \n\nPrognosis and treatment varies greatly but is often based on the etiology of disease.  Benign causes of SVC syndrome that can resolve completely if the underlying benign disease is treated. In other cases, such as advanced malignancy, the goal of therapy is palliation, such as use of radiation therapy or vascular stent placement. In general, surgical care is not the best option. \n\nAs most cases of SVC syndrome are due to malignancy, a key question is how advanced the disease as progressed.  If tumor is infiltrating the SVC (and mediastinum), resection will not provide a cure.  In cases of advanced malignancy, the goal of therapy is palliation, such as use of radiation therapyto shrink tumor burden or vascular stent placement for symptom relief. In general, surgical care is not the best option in these cases.   Steroids have been used for temporary relief of symptoms, but chronic steroid use can cause systemic fluid retention, which often exacerbates this condition.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"SVC syndromelung cancervenous congestion","Reference":"Up to date (Online)\n\nWan JF, Bezjak A. \u201cSuperior Vena Cava Syndrome\u201d Hematology\/Oncology Clinics of North America. 2010 Jun;24(3):501-13.","Title":"Superior Vena Cava Syndrome"}}

The lesion is typically subcentimeter, unifocal, and causes pain that is worst at night and relieved within 20-25 minutes of taking aspirin.  It can occur virtually anywhere in the skeleton, but most commonly appears in the femoral neck, tibial midshaft, and diaphysis of other long bones. Rarely, osteoid osteomas occur in the bones of the face.    Patients are usually between 10 and 35 years old.\n\nConventional radiography and CT imaging typically reveal a benign-appearing, cortical, medullary, or subperiosteal radiolucency surrounded by a well-defined zone of sclerosis.  Often, a radiodense nidus is seen centrally.  90% of osteoid osteomas show intense focal uptake on bone scan.  CT is becoming the diagnostic modality of choice, as its capacity for excellent bony detail easily demonstrates the characteristic sclerotic nidus within the sclerotic-rimmed lucency, and allows precise location of the lesion.  MRI may define a nidus that remains unapparent on CT or scintigraphy, but is not generally employed.\n\nDifferential diagnosis includes stress fracture, cortical abcess, and intracortical osteosarcoma in cortical lesions; Brodie's abcess, bone island, and osteoblastoma in medullary lesions.  The characteristic appearance of osteoid osteoma often is enough to confirm the diagnosis.  Osteoid osteomas lack the lucent lines of stress fractures, the lucent tracts of abcesses, the bulging cortical disruptions of osteosarcoma, the periosteal reaction of osteoblastoma, and the normal bone scan and \u201cbrush\u201d trabecular borders of bone islands.  Intense focal uptake on bone scan may confirm the diagnosis.  \n\nThese lesions are treated by either curettage or percutaneous radiofrequency ablation, often with CT or gamma camera guidance.

Osteomyelitis may spread by a hematogenous route, from a contiguous contaminated source (e.g. following trauma, bone surgery, or joint replacement), or be a complication of vascular insufficiency (predominantly in diabetic patients).  Staphylococcus aureus is by far the common pathogen causing osteomyelitis.  The infection may be acute or chronic; acute infections tend to evolve over several days to weeks. Acute infection may resolve with appropriate treatment. Osteomyelitis that is untreated or insufficiently treated may give rise to a chronic infection which may be characterized by a sequestrum (necrotic bone, bacteria, and granulation that have been walled off by new reactive bone or fibrous tissue).  Chronic osteomyelitis is also characterized by the persistence of microorganisms, low-grade inflammation, and fistulous tracts.  Recurrent osteomyelitis in the same area along with the presence of fever is indicative of a chronic infection.  The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and when possible, identification of the offending organism by blood culture or direct bone biopsy.\n\nPlain radiographs should be the first imaging modality for evaluating osteomyelitis. Initially they may be normal or only show periosteal reaction and soft tissue swelling.  Bone destruction (osteolytic foci on the radiographs) may not be visible until 10-21 days after the infection has begun.  With chronicity, reactive osteosclerosis as well as areas of osteolysis and sequestra and involucra may occur. Differentiation of acute osteomyelitis from inactive chronic osteomyelitis can be difficult, but certain indications on the radiograph aid in distinguishing between the two, including a change from a previous radiograph, poorly defined areas of osteolysis,  and thin and linear periostitis.  Although CT is useful for evaluating cortical destruction, sequestration, cloacae, and bone and soft tissue abscesses,  MR imaging (T1-weighted, T2-weighted with fat sat and post contrast sequences) is the best modality for evaluating osteomyelitis, cellulitis and areas of necrosis for debridement. Tc 99m \u2013bone scintigraphy may also be useful for diagnosing osteomyelitis but does not have the resolution of MRI.  Dual isotope bone-granulocyte scintigraphy (Tc 99m MDPbone and white blood cells labeled with Indium-111) has a high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (71%) in detecting areas of acute infection. However, MRI has increased sensitivity and accuracy in the detection of osteomyelitis as compared to three-phase bone scintigraphy.  In cases of acute osteomyelitis, the process is identified as area(s) of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity images in the medullary canal on fat-saturated T2-weighted  MR images or STIR (short tau inversion recovery) MR images. Cellulitis shows similar findings (low-signal-intensity  foci on T1-weighted images and high-signal-intensity foci on fat-saturated T2-weighted or STIR MR images). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted  MR imaging shows not only the enhancement of areas of osteomyelitis and cellulitis, but also shows non-enhancing areas of necrosis important for debridement.  Active and inactive phases of osteomyelitis may be differentiated by  in the acute phase the presence of periosteal bone formation with subperiosteal fluid and areas of high signal intensity areas on T2-weighted and STIR MR images that enhance after contrast media.  Bone sclerosis is low signal intensity on MR sequences. Abscesses and tracts can also be demonstrated on MRI.

Chronic osteomyelitis is also characterized by the persistence of microorganisms, low-grade inflammation, and fistulous tracts.  Recurrent osteomyelitis in the same area along with the presence of fever is indicative of a chronic infection.  The diagnosis of osteomyelitis is based on clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings, and when possible, identification of the offending organism by blood culture or direct bone biopsy.\n\nPlain radiographs should be the first imaging modality for evaluating osteomyelitis. Initially they may be normal or only show periosteal reaction and soft tissue swelling.  Bone destruction (osteolytic foci on the radiographs) may not be visible until 10-21 days after the infection has begun.  With chronicity, reactive osteosclerosis as well as areas of osteolysis and sequestra and involucra may occur. Differentiation of acute osteomyelitis from inactive chronic osteomyelitis can be difficult, but certain indications on the radiograph aid in distinguishing between the two, including a change from a previous radiograph, poorly defined areas of osteolysis,  and thin and linear periostitis.  Although CT is useful for evaluating cortical destruction, sequestration, cloacae, and bone and soft tissue abscesses,  MR imaging (T1-weighted, T2-weighted with fat sat and post contrast sequences) is the best modality for evaluating osteomyelitis, cellulitis and areas of necrosis for debridement. Tc 99m \u2013bone scintigraphy may also be useful for diagnosing osteomyelitis but does not have the resolution of MRI.  Dual isotope bone-granulocyte scintigraphy (Tc 99m MDP)bone and white blood cells labeled with Indium-111) has a high sensitivity (84%) and specificity (71%) in detecting areas of acute infection. However, MRI has increased sensitivity and accuracy in the detection of osteomyelitis as compared to three-phase bone scintigraphy.  In cases of acute osteomyelitis, the process is identified as area(s) of low signal intensity on T1-weighted images and high signal intensity images in the medullary canal on fat-saturated T2-weighted  MR images or STIR (short tau inversion recovery) MR images. Cellulitis shows similar findings (low-signal-intensity  foci on T1-weighted MR images and high-signal-intensity foci on fat-saturated T2-weighted or STIR MR images). Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted  MR imaging shows not only the enhancement of areas of osteomyelitis and cellulitis, but also shows non-enhancing areas of necrosis important for debridement.  Active and inactive phases of osteomyelitis may be differentiated by periosteal bone formation with subperiosteal fluid and by areas of high signal intensity areas on T2-weighted and STIR MR images that enhance after contrast media.  Bone sclerosis is low signal intensity on MR sequences. Abscesses and tracts can also be demonstrated on MRI.  For definitive histologic diagnosis, fluoroscopy and\/or CT is used to biopsy appendicular and axial lesions and fluoroscopy can be sometimes use for biopsying appendicular lesions. Deep abscesses can be drained with CT guidance and superficial abscesses with sonographic or CT guidance.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Acute on chronic osteomyelitisPost-traumatic  changes with deformity after trauma","Reference":"(1)\tLew, DP, Waldvogel, FA.

They are comprised of mature adipose cells separated into lobules by fibrovascular septations.  Patients may present with or without localized pain of variable duration and a variable amount of soft tissue swelling.  Many of these lesions are discovered incidentally.  Intraosseous lipomas may be seen in patients of all ages, with a predilection for young to middle age adults.  They are most commonly detected in the metaphysis or epiphysis of the long bones of the lower extremity with 50% involving the femur, tibia, and fibula.  These tumors may also be found in other long bones, the skull and jaws, ribs, pelvis, and frequently (15%) in the calcaneus, which is the most common tarsal bone involved.\n\nThe typical plain film appearance of intraosseous lipomas is a geographic, well marginated, osteolytic lesion with a thin sclerotic rim.  Lobulations at the margins or internal osseous ridges are common as is a central nidus of dystrophic calcification, which is nearly pathognomonic for this tumor.  This central calcification is secondary to fat necrosis.  Osseous expansion may be evident, especially in bones of small caliber.  Computed tomography demonstrates attenuation similar to subcutaneous fat with regions of cystic changes. The differential diagnosis includes simple bone cyst (unicameral), fibrous dysplasia, and when calcified, enchondroma and clear cell chondrosarcoma.  Bone infarct is also a diagnostic consideration.   If the lesion is in the calcaneous, normal trabecular variation (pseudocyst) secondary to the absence of stress and resulting atrophy of bony trabeculation should be considered.  \n\nMRI findings are pathognomonic.  Lesions include regions of fat with high signal intensity on T1 weighted sequences and low signal intensity on T2 weighted fat suppressed and STIR sequences.  This may be combined with internal areas of low signal calcification and peripheral thick or thin rims of low signal sclerosis.  On T1 weighted MR images, the homogenous high signal intensity of the lipoma is demarcated from the fat in the bone marrow by a sharp margined rim of low signal intensity.  A dark, central focus is commonly seen and corresponds to dystrophic calcification.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"benignneoplasmbone","Reference":"Diagnosis of Bone and Joint Disorders (4th Ed)\/edited by) Donald Resnick\u2014W.B.

They are thought to arise from the enclosure of ectodermal elements when the neural tube closes at 3-5 weeks gestation.  Additionally, acquired epidermoid tumors may occur as the result of trauma, although this is relatively uncommon in the brain.  Epidermoids are composed of an outer capsule of connective tissue that surrounds a layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium and inner cystic fluid that includes debris, keratin, water, and cholesterol.  As the epithelial layer desquamates, the cells accumulate and form a cholesterol-rich layer that gives the tumor its characteristic pearly white appearance.  Epidermoids subtly grow within the CSF spaces, surrounding and encasing adjacent neurovascular structures.  The tumor has an irregular and lobulated cauliflower-like outer surface that shines like a \u201cmother of pearl.\u201d\n\nThe majority of intracranial epidermoid tumors are intradural lesions, in the basal subarachnoid spaces occurring off-midline.  Between 40%-50% of cases are found in the cerebellopontine angle cistern.  After schwannoma and meningioma, epidermoid tumors are the third most common cerebellopontine angle mass.  Epidermoid tumors also occur in the sellar and parasellar regions.  Less commonly, epidermoid tumors have been reported in the cerebral hemispheres, brain stem, and rarely in the lateral ventricles.  Approximately ten percent of epidermoid tumors are extradural, occurring in the skull or spine.\n\nEpidermoid tumors are benign slow-growing tumors, and malignant degeneration is extremely rare.  \n\nClinical Features:\n\nClinical features of epidermoid tumors are usually secondary to the mass effect of the tumor on adjacent structures.  Gait disturbance, cranial neuropathies, and occasionally seizures are presenting symptoms.  Hydrocephalus is not commonly seen with intracranial epidermoid tumors.   Additionally, symptoms related to chemical meningitis caused by leakage of tumor contents into the subarachnoid space may be seen.\n\nRadiology:\n\nEpidermoid tumors on CT are well-circumscribed, homogenous lobulated extra-axial masses, that are nonenhancing, and hypoattenuating, and are similar to CSF, secondary to the presence of solid cholesterol and\/or loculated CSF within the tumor, and rarely demonstrate calcification.\n\nMR imaging is the best modality for evaluating these tumors.  Typically, epidermoid tumors demonstrate a lamellated appearance on MR imaging, secondary to the desquamated squamous epithelium.  Most epidermoid tumors have signal intensities that are near CSF signal, low to intermediate on T1 weighted images, and slightly hyperintense on T2 weighted images.  The main differential diagnostic consideration is that of an arachnoid cyst, with arachnoid cyst following the signal intensity patterns of CSF with all MR pulse sequences, whereas epidermoid tumors are not hypointense on FLAIR images and demonstrate areas of hyperintense signal relative to CSF.  Furthermore, on DW images, epidermoid tumors demonstrate restricted diffusion, which is not characteristic of arachnoid cysts.  Additionally, approximately 25% of epidermoid tumors will demonstrate a thin rim of peripheral enhancement following the administration of contrast material.  Furthermore, employing the use of a high resolution gradient-echo T2 sequence, such as 3D Fast Imaging Employing STeady-state Acquisition (FIESTA) the lamellated epidermoid tumor is clearly depicted as low signal intensity as it is contrasted against a hyperintense CSF background, achieving a precise preoperative assessment of surgical anatomy.\n\nFinally, the signal characteristics of epidermoid tumors vary depending on its composition.  Rarely, epidermoids will appear hyperattenuated on CT, secondary to elevated protein content, with reversal of signal characteristics on MR imaging, high signal intensity on T1WI, and low signal intensity on T2WI.  \n\nTreatment:  \n\nSubtotal resection is usually performed to alleviate compression of adjacent structures, and to avoid damaging vital structures.  The reported rate of recurrence of epidermoid tumors is highly variable.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Epidermoid TumorCPA MassFIESTA","Reference":"Brant: Fundamentals of Diagnostic Radiology. 2nd Edition.

CT findings used to differentiate one form of colitis from another include:\n\nDegree of mural thickening\nExtent to which the layers of the thickened colonic wall are visible\nPresence of fistulae or abscesses\nAnatomic distribution of the CT abnormalities in the large and small intestine\n\n \nUlcerative colitis involves the rectum in virtually all patients. It extends proximally in one continuous segment to involve the remainder of the colon to a variable extent. Computed tomography shows mild-to-moderate, concentric, mural thickening.  The mucosa, the low-density, thickened submucosa, and the serosa are usually visible as three distinct layers. These abnormalities sometimes give the rectum a target-like appearance.  In most patients, there is loss of the normal haustral contour and the colon is shortened. Fistulae and pericolonic abscesses are rare. Proliferation of the perirectal fat is also commonly seen.\n\nIn patients with Crohn disease (granulomatous colitis), the entire colon and distal small bowel may be involved; the most common sites are the terminal ileum, right colon, and rectum. Normal intervening segments, so-called skip areas, often separate affected segments of bowel. The colonic wall tends to be thicker than in patients with ulcerative colitis.  The layers of the affected bowel wall may be similar in CT attenuation, giving the wall a homogeneous appearance, but this is not always the case.  Typically, there is inflammation of the pericolonic fat, which appears as a diffuse, hazy increase in its CT attenuation, reflecting the transmural nature of this disease.  As in patients with ulcerative colitis, carcinoma can occasionally develop. In this setting, adenocarcinoma is sometimes scirrhous in type and its CT appearance can mimic that of a benign inflammatory stricture.  Fistulae are common in patients with granulomatous colitis, particularly in the perirectal area.  Abdominal abscesses also may develop adjacent to severely affected segments of bowel.\n\nPseudomembranous colitis is caused by toxins produced by Clostridium difficile, a gram-positive bacterium that colonizes the gastrointestinal tract in some patients receiving antibiotic therapy.  CT shows characteristic marked thickening of the colonic wall and interhaustral folds, which are sometimes so severe as to nearly obliterate the colonic lumen.  The entire colon is usually involved, but involvement confined to the right colon is not unusual.  Strand-like pattern of edema in the pericolonic fat is present in nearly half of cases.  Fifteen percent of patients have ascites.\n\nCytomegalovirus colitis is seen in the setting of an immunocompromised patient.  Findings mimic those of C. difficile disease, with profound thickening of the colonic wall and haustra and pericolonic edema.  In both conditions, the mural thickening is largely the result of an edematous submucosal layer that has a low CT attenuation value. \n\nDisseminated histoplasmosis is being seen with increasing frequency because of the susceptibility of patients with AIDS to this disease, especially in endemic areas.  Colonic lesions often have an \u201capple-core\u201d appearance on barium enema, which appear on CT as one or more focal areas of mural thickening with adjacent adenopathy of mixed attenuation.  Usually, tissue diagnosis is required to separate these lesions from adenocarcinoma.\n\nColitis due to Schistosoma japonicum presents as left colon mild mural thickening with obliteration of the normal haustral pattern.  Frequently, there is a peculiar pattern of curvilinear calcification in the colonic wall.  Since dense radioopaque contrast can obscure these calcifications, water should be considered as a colonic contrast agent when schistosomiasis is considered a possible etiology. \n\nBeh?et disease most commonly involves the ileocecal region and ascending, but abnormalities may occur anywhere in the colon.  Marked focal thickening of the colonic wall surrounds isolated large cecal ulcers.  This appearance may easily be confused with the ileocecal mural thickening of tuberculosis, which may be distinguished based on associated with low-density caseating lymph nodes in the mesentery.  In the setting of neutropenia, typhlitis may present with low-attenuation cecal mural thickening, with or without mural gas.\n\nFinally, a noninflammatory etiology that must be considered is ischemia.  This classically involves the descending colon and may involve the spenic flexure and sigmoid region.  Expect to see a segmental area of mural thickening which may be severe enough to narrow the lumen.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":"Lee JK, Sagel SS, Stanley RJ, Heiken JP, ed.

They are strongly associated with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome.  10-20% of hemangioblastomas occur with VHL syndrome and approximately 45% of patients with VHL syndrome eventually develop a hemangioblastoma.  95% of hemangioblastomas occur in the posterior fossa (fewer than 100 case reports exist of supratentorial locations), and overall they account for 7-12% of all posterior fossa tumors in adults (including primary and metastatic tumors). \n\nPathologically, hemangioblastomas are highly vascular tumors comprised primarily of capillaries and pericytes (aka \u201cstromal\u201d cells).  While their World Health Organization classification remains under tumors of uncertain histogenesis, hemangioblastomas may arise from embryonic plexus epithelium based upon their expression of transthyretin and transferrin.  They are typically well circumscribed, with 60% being cystic with a mural nodule and 40% being solid.  Their solid\/nodular component is composed of tightly packed blood vessels varying in size from capillaries to cavernous, with the nidus of the tumor abutting the pial surface.  Hemangioblastomas do not have a capsule, and when cystic, their wall is composed of compressed neural glial cells.  The associated cystic fluid is xanthochromic, with a concentration of amino acids, alkaline phosphates, and mucoproteins similar to that of blood, suggesting origination from diffusion from the solid vascular component of the tumor.\n\nHemangioblastomas are rare in children and typically present during the third to fifth decade.  They typically grow slowly and clinical presentation depends upon the tumor size and location.  Posterior fossa tumors can present with minor neurological symptoms for months followed by an acute exacerbation.  The most common symptoms include: headache, vomiting, and ataxia.  A distinguishing clinical presentation of hemangioblastomas is their potential to present with polycythemia secondary to tumoral production of erythropoietin.  This occurs in approximately 20% of posterior fossa tumors, and is more commonly seen in solid hemangioblastomas.  Surgical resection is considered standard of care, however recurrence is seen in approximately 25% of cases, most frequently in association with VHL syndrome.\n\nCT evaluation of hemangioblastomas classically demonstrates a large, low density, cystic-appearing cerebellar mass.  The addition of intravenous contrast material greatly increases the ability to identify a strongly enhancing mural nodule adjacent to the pial surface.  Solid tumors enhance strongly and uniformly.  During angiography, the common pattern is a large avascular posterior fossa mass with a small, highly vascular mural nodule.  A prolonged vascular stain is typical.  MR imaging reveals the cystic component with a low signal on T1-weighted sequences and a high signal on T2-weighted sequences.  The solid\/nodular component is variable in its signal characteristics, and typically is heterogeneously isointense on T1-weighted sequences and hyperintense on T2-weighted sequences.  Intense enhancement following gadolinium is typical.

In the majority of cases, these malformations occur unilaterally, although bilaterality can occur.  When these findings occur unilaterally, and without vertebral involvement, the disorder is often referred to as hemifacial microsomia.  Additional involvement of the vertebral bodies is then referred to as Goldenhar syndrome.  Overall these grouped malformations fall under the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum (OAV spectrum).  The heart, limbs and kidneys can also be affected within this spectrum.\n\n     Goldenhar syndrome is believed to occur randomly without an any genetic cause, although research into a multifactoral inheritance pattern is ongoing.  This disorder occurs more frequently in males (~70%), and is associated clinically with hearing, vision, and mastication problems.  Affected patients typically enjoy normal life expectancies and normal intelligence (approximately 10% of patient display moderate learning disabilities).

Pain is usually the initial presenting complaint and often starts in the peri-umbilical region before migrating to the right lower quadrant with maximal tenders often located at McBurney\u2019s point.  This typical sequence is absent in more than 1\/3 of older children.  Often pain is worse with movement, coughing (cough sign) driving over bump (cat\\'s eye sign), or standing on toes and dropping heels to ground (heel drop sign) (Rothrock).  Vomiting occurs in the majority of school-aged children and may precede or begin concurrent with pain.  Physical exam often reveals an elevated temperature and tenderness to palpation in the right lower quadrant.  However, tenderness may involve the entire lower abdomen, or may be diffuse, especially with a perforation.  Compared with those with non-perforated appendicitis, children with perforated appendicitis are significantly younger, have a longer duration of symptoms before diagnosis, have more physician visits before correct diagnosis, have higher temperatures, and are more likely to exhibit vomiting, diffuse abdominal tenderness, and peritoneal signs (Rothrock).  Perforation generally occurs 36 to 48 hours after the onset of symptoms.     Plain abdominal radiographs have been recommended as potentially useful for evaluating children with suspected appendicitis.  Radiographic findings believed to be suggestive of appendicitis include rightward scoliosis, soft tissue masses, localized ileus, bowel obstruction, calcified fecolith, and free peritoneal fluid.  Of these features, the most specific for appendicitis is a calcified fecolith (appendicolith) found in up to 13% to 22% with appendicitis and in only 1% to 2% of those without (Rothrock).  While often recommended, these films rarely altered a patient\\'s diagnosis or management.       Ultrasonography is appropriate in patients in which the diagnosis is unclear by history and physical examination, especially in pediatric and female patients.  A normal appendix must be identified to rule out appendicitis.  An inflamed appendix usually measures greater than 6 mm in diameter, is non-compressible and tender with focal compression (Hardin).  Numerous other right lower quadrant conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, cecal diverticulitis, Meckel\\'s diverticulum, endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease can cause false-positive ultrasonography results (Hardin).       Appendiceal CT is more accurate than ultrasound and consists of a focused, helical CT after a Gastrografin-saline enema.  It can be performed and interpreted usually within an hour.  The accuracy of CT is due in part to its ability to identify a normal appendix better than ultrasound.  If appendiceal CT is not available, standard abdominal\/pelvic CT with contrast remains useful and may still be more accurate than ultrasound (Hardin).     The standard for management of appendicitis remains appendectomy.  The procedure may be performed by laparotomy (usually through a small right lower quadrant incision) or laparoscopy.  While laparoscopic intervention is advantageous in adults due to decreased postoperative pain, earlier return to normal activity and better cosmetic results, an open appendectomy remains the primary approach to treatment in children due to their smaller size (Rothrock).\n\nhttp:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15155894","External Links":"www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/entrez\/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&dopt=Abstract&list_uids=15155894","Keywords":"appendicitis","Reference":"Contran, et al.

Cerebral hemorrhage is the next most common with almost 1 in 5 patients.  Venous occlusive disease is the next, but much less frequent than the previous mentioned etiologies.\n\nThe two most common causes of thromboembolic disease are atherosclerosis and cardiac origin.  Atherosclerosis follows a typical distribution of accumulation within the arterial distribution of the brain.  The internal carotid artery is first, then the distal basilar artery, carotid siphon, and middle cerebral artery.  The parts of the brain perfused by the middle cerebral artery and basilar artery are most vulnerable to infarct due both the region of atherosclerotic disease and flow patterns that cause more proximal sources of thrombus to favor those vessels.\n\nThe first patient\u2019s infarct is due to occlusion of penetrating vessels of the right middle cerebral artery.  Likely the lenticulostriates which supply the lentiform nucleus, caudate capsule, and internal capsule, as well as the thalamoperferators were affected.  These types of strokes, when smaller than 15mm, are called lacunar infarcts and they account for 20% of all strokes.  Patients with lacunar infarcts can present with a pure motor hemiparesis like this patient or a pure hemisensory deficit, hemiparetic ataxia, dysarthria, or hand deficit.\n\nCT examination early in the course of an acute stroke can be negative and cannot exclude this diagnosis.  Stroke in the emergent setting is more a clinical diagnosis and if suspected, imaging with MR is prudent.

Mafee, MD \n\nDISCUSSION:\t\nThe membranous labyrinth or cavity consists of the cochlear aqueduct, the vestibular organ, the endolymphatic duct and sac, the round window membrane, and their associated vasculature.  The bony labyrinth includes the vestibule, the semicircular canals, and the cochlea.  The membranous labyrinth of the inner ear begins to form during the early months of gestation.  By mid-term, the mesenchyme that surrounds the labyrinth has transformed into cartilage, and begins to ossify.  The endolymphatic duct and sac are the only portions that grow after birth, and they continue to enlarge until sometime after puberty.\n\nThere is considerable controversy concerning the origin of these slowly growing, yet highly destructive lesions of the temporal bone.  Several recent reports have emphasized that these tumors probably do arise from the epithelial elements lining the endolymphatic system (especially the sac).  The most common presentation is hearing loss, facial nerve palsy, and vestibular dysfunction. \n\nThere appear to be at least 2 categories of this lesion, a slowly growing, relatively benign adenomatous tumor, and a more aggressive lesion with a capillary configuration.  The papillary lesions probably arise within the posterior aspects of the petrous bone in the retrolabyrinthine region.  The lesions may be hypervascular, supplied by  branches of the external carotid artery, and may contain blood products that produce characteristic regions of hyperintensity on T1WI and hypointensity on T2WI.  Intratumoral calcifications within these lesions may represent \"bone sequestra\" produced when the tumor infiltrates into the petrous bone.  Because these lesions may be surrounded by a thin shell of reactive bone, it has been suggested that at least during some portion of their growth, they may expand relatively slowly.  The lesions almost invariably show contrast enhancement.  Some of the tumors have a speckled pattern of hyperintensity on T1WI, which can mimic the appearance of other vascular lesions of the petrous apex, including glomus tumors.\n\nThe papillary endolymphatic sac tumor has been associated with von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL)and may present with bilateral papillary endolymphatic sac neoplasms.  It is also interesting to remember that patients with VHL may develop cystadenomas in the testis and in relationship to the female pelvic adnexa.  \n\nIn this patient, the differential diagnosis could include chondroid lesions (benign chondroma as well as low-grade chondrosarcoma, and chondromyxoid fibroma), cholesterol granuloma, metastatic disease, and possibly an aggressive epidermoid cyst.\n\nBecause the histology of this lesion may be confusing to surgical pathologists, an accurate preoperative localization by neuroimaging can assist in suggesting the correct diagnosis.  The prognosis can be quite good after careful gross removal of the lesion.  However, incomplete resection is associated with recurrence.\n\nSUGGESTED READINGS:\n\nBatsakis, J.G. and el-Naggar, A.K.

Quoted figures are in the order of 1 to 10 cases per 100,00 population per year, but this is almost certainly an underestimate as many cases remain subclinical.  Sarcoidosis occurs with about 10 times greater frequency in blacks than in whites.  \n\nPresentation is most common between 20 and 40 years of age.  The mode of presentation varies among series, depending on racial mix and the use of screening radiography.  In white-dominated series, presentation as an incidental radiographic finding is common and may occur in 40-50% of cases.  Respiratory illness, erythema nodosum, ocular symptoms, and other skin lesions represent the other common presentations.  In predominantly black series, respiratory and systemic symptoms like fatigue, malaise, weakness, weight loss, and fever are most common.\n\nA firm diagnosis for sarcoidosis can be made with consistent clinicoradiologic findings and histologic evidence of widespread non-caseating granulomas in more than one organ or a positive Kveim skin test.  In clinical practice the organs most commonly sampled are lymph nodes, liver, and lung. \n\nLaboratory investigations also show elevated serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels.  Serum ACE levels correlate with degree of total body granuloma burden and the activity of clinical disease as a whole but not convincingly with the degree of and activity of pulmonary disease.  \n\nSarcoidosis can be managed conservatively.  If treatment is indicated then steroids are the agents of choice.  Indications for treating chest disease are not firmly established but most patients with symptomatic or progressive stage II or III disease will be on treatment.  There is no doubt in the short-term efficacy of steroids but the long-term value is less clear.  The majority of deaths from sarcoidosis are related to pulmonary or cardiac disease. \n\nSarcoidosis is commonly staged according to its appearance on the chest radiograph:\n\nStage 0 \u2013 clear\nStage I \u2013 node enlargement only\nStage II \u2013 node enlargement and parenchymal shadowing\nStage III \u2013 parenchymal shadowing only\nStage IV \u2013 Fibrosis with distortion and bullae\n\nThe stage at presentation is generally considered to correlate with prognosis.\n\nLymphadenopathy is the most common intrathoracic manifestation of sarcoidosis.  Symmetric, bilateral hilar adenopathy with some form of paratracheal adenopathy is the classic pattern.  Fluctuation in nodal enlargement during intermittent steroid treatment is well recognized.  Sarcoid nodes may calcify.\n\nParenchymal shadowing is seen at the time of presentation in a little under a half of the patients with sarcoidosis.  A practical division is that between reversible and irreversible opacities.  \n\nReversible changes consist of three patterns:  reticulonodular opacities, ill-defined opacities with characteristics of consolidation (alveolar), and large nodules.  These patterns can occur alone or in varying combinations.  They may resolve partially or completely, or they may progress to a irreversible, fibrotic pattern.  Such fibrosis ranges from minor and radiologically undetectable, to gross with scar-like shadowing and distortion on the chest radiograph.\n\nOn HRCT, sarcoidosis is characterized by mid-upper zone peribronchovascular thickening and irregularity with small nodules distributed in a perilymphatic fashion: along bronchovascular margins, along interlobular septa, and subpleurally (including fissures).  The most common and almost universal finding is small, 1 to 5 mm nodules, usually with irregular but sharp borders.  \n\nFocal opacities larger than 1cm in diameter maybe cause by localized areas of consolidation \u2013 alveolar sarcoid \u2013 characterized by ill-defined margins and an air bronchogram.  \n\nGround glass opacity is seen in about 40% of patients.  It is patchy and may have a lobular distribution.  Ground glass opacity is usually produced by multiple granulomas rather than alveolitis.\n\nScarring causes a number of signs: lobular distortion, traction bronchiolectasis, honeycombing, and cyst or bullae formation.  Nodules, consolidation, ground-glass opacity, and septal lines are potentially reversible.  On the contrary irregular course lines, cysts, honeycombing, bronchiolectasis, and distortion are permanent.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Sarcoidosis","Reference":"1. Peter Armstrong et al.

Although the true incidence is unknown, it occurs in approximately 1 in 500 live births.  About sixty percent present in the first month of life, twenty percent present between one month and one year.  Intestinal malrotation in adults is rare.  Zissen suggests this anomaly should be sought in patients with a situs problem, inferior vena cava anomalies, polysplenia, or preduodenal portal vein.  \n\nAcute appendicitis in adults, although less frequent than in adolescents, is much more common than adult malrotation.  Both can present with obstructive symptoms in up to 50% of cases.  Like a symptomatic malrotation, an acute appendicitis requires immediate surgery for repair.  A symptomatic malrotation requires a Ladd\u2019s procedure.  An acute appendicitis requires an appendectomy.  \n\nZissen warns that intestinal malrotation in adults is usually an incidental finding on CT.  Therefore, it is important to continue to look for the cause of any acute symptoms.  Intestinal malrotation can be diagnosed on CT by the anatomic location of a right-sided small bowel, left-sided colon and an abnormal relationship of the superior mesenteric vessels.  Acute appendicitis will show inflammatory changes of the appendix associated with fat stranding, bowel wall thickening, luminal expansion and occasionally frank phlegmon.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"MalrotationAcute Appendicitis","Reference":"Kamal I, Defuising the intra-abdominal ticking bomb:  intestinal malrotation in children.

There are three primary modes of spread:\n\nlocal invasion or infiltration\nblood-borne (hematogenous) dissemination\nlymphatic spread\n\nHematogenous dissemination is the most common and usually the most serious type of tumor spread.  Most solid tumors larger than 4-5 milimeters in size grow their own blood vessels. [See Angiogenesis - http:\/\/rad.medpix.net\/medpix\/radpix.html?mode=single&recnum=2733 ]  The tumor has \"angiogenic\" factors that stimulate blood vessels.  Many of these same tumors also have angioinvasive factors that allow the tumor to penetrate through vessel walls.  Therefore, the tumor is richly vascularized - giving it a path to the systemic circulation; and, once the tumor \"embolizes\" the small tumor fragments are able to erode through the vessel and implant into the surrounding tissue.  Thus creating a metastatic deposit.\n\nThere is a \"cascade\" theory for tumor embolization and metastasis.  Blood from the gut is \"filtered\" in the liver, and gastrointestinal metastases usually begin in the liver before they spread to other organs.  The lung filters all of the systemic blood as it passes through, and metastatic disease here is common from all tumor sources.  Brain and bone metastases usually occur after the lung has been affected - at least in theory.  Some solid organs are affected more than others merely because they filter more blood - like the kidney, adrenal gland, and brain.","External Links":null,"Keywords":null,"Reference":null,"Title":"Metastatic disease"}}

There are numerous major and minor features and diagnosis depends on 2 major features or 1 major and 2 minor features.  Approximately half of the cases are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, and the other half are sporadic.  Classically, the clinical presentation \"zits, fits, nit-wits\"--adenoma sebacum, seizures and mental retardation.\n \nThis systemic disorder affects many systems.  In the brain, it causes hamartomas in subependymal and subcortical (the Tubers) locations.  The tubers may calcify, and may have enhancement on MRI.  The subependymal hamartomas are most commonly located near the Foramen of Monroe.  Additionally these patients are predisposed to Subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.\n\nAbout half of these patients will have renal angiomyolipomas (fatty containg masses).  These are usually bilateral and multiple.  50% will have numerous bone islands, periosteal thickening and or bone cysts.

The etiology of the disease is not well defined. Some investigators favor an inflammatory pathogenesis while others consider PVNS a form of benign neoplasm. Other etiologies-metabolic, traumatic, and genetic-have also been considered.  Although both polyclonal & monoclonal lineages of synovial cells have been demonstrated, current opinion favors a neoplastic process (2). \n\nA 1980 epidemiologic study of 166 patients reported the incidence of this tumor as 1.8-2 per million per year (3). There appears to be no sex predilection. The most common sites of involvement are the knee, hip, ankle, shoulder, & elbow in decreasing order of frequency (4).  \n\nWhen the knee is involved symptoms are typically non-specific with pain, effusion, & warmth being the most frequently reported. Range of motion becomes limited as the mass occupies more space. Studies are generally normal with the exception of gross blood upon aspiration of the joint space (4).\n\nMR imaging is the primary modality for evaluating PVNS. Radiographs are used in the initial evaluation and are helpful in delineating osseous erosions. Synovial chondromatosis and PVNS are the two main differentials to consider when radiographs show well mineralized bones and focal sites of erosion. Absence of calcifications and characteristic MR imaging findings, however, are more suggestive of PVNS. On MR imaging PVNS appears as an intra-articular soft tissue mass (or masses) and can exhibit variable signal intensity depending on the amount of hemosiderin deposition, lipid filled macrophages, & fibrosis (4). Villous or cystic low-signal-intensity masses combined with a \u201cblooming\u201d artifact on the gradient-recalled echo sequence are nearly pathognomonic for PVNS. After contrast, PVNS will enhance. In the absence of typical MR findings, CT-guided biopsy should be considered. At histology, the presence of mononuclear cells, multinucleated giant cells, and hemosiderin deposition are consistent with the diagnosis of PVNS (4). \n\nThe traditional treatment of PVNS is total synovectomy (5). Post-surgical adjuvant radiation, either external beam or by intra-articular injection, has shown promise in some small case series (6,7). The ultimate goal of treatment is to remove the mass and prevent recurrence while preserving maximum joint function. Severe progression of the disease can lead to joint destruction and a need for arthrodesis.","External Links":null,"Keywords":"Pigmented villonodular synovitisPVNSBenign neoplasm","Reference":"1.
